Mr Redman said the panel determined Kimberley Asparagus met all criteria at a high level and demonstrated its understanding of growing in local conditions, export potential, and had retail opportunities to sell its product. \"Kimberley Asparagus was chosen as it had a clear vision for expanding horticultural opportunities in the Kimberley region, which will also boost job opportunities in the region,\" he said. \"The prospective economic benefits for WA are significant, with the potential to create export opportunities for the asparagus which will be produced.\" The land release was made possible by the Liberal National Government's unprecedented investment in agriculture under the $350 million Seizing the Opportunity Agriculture initiative, made possible by the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. It is expected 55 jobs will be created, with flow-on benefits including revitalisation of the regional economy, purchase of technical services and investment in the community.\u00a0 The proposal will also earn export income for WA.

WAEDOCS has already developed a guideline for the admission and inpatient treatment of people with eating disorders in WA.

    "statement": "Western Australia's new tourism marketing campaign, launched today by Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett, is expected to generate millions of dollars for the State's economy.  The campaign, Just Another Day in WA, was developed by Tourism Western Australia and advertising agency Cummins&Partners to show people around the world the extraordinary experiences that can be found in Western Australia. The Premier said the premise behind the campaign was to highlight the things that West Australians took for granted but visitors found memorable and extraordinary. \"West Australians tend to be blas\u00e9 about the beauty and uniqueness of our magnificent State, so what is seen as extraordinary for a visitor is just another day in WA for us,\" Mr Barnett said. Extensive research carried out during the campaign's development revealed that few people outside of WA were aware of the transformation of Perth and its surrounds, or appreciated how Western Australia was different from other places in the country. The Premier said to address these knowledge gaps, the Just Another Day in WA campaign would feature Perth content and highlight what was unique about regional WA. \"Our recent tourism marketing campaigns have focused almost exclusively on regional WA but greater Perth has gone through some dramatic changes and has a lot to offer as a destination in its own right,\" he said.  \"As Perth continues to evolve, so will the campaign and we will be able to share more Perth stories with the world.\" The Premier said the groundbreaking campaign marked a fundamental shift in the way Tourism WA promoted the State as a holiday destination. \"Under the Just Another Day banner, Tourism WA and the tourism industry will create and distribute appealing content that will inspire people to travel to our State,\" he said. \"It will be distributed across the globe through our co-operative advertising campaigns, airlines, travel agents and tour operators. \"We are calling on all West Australians to contribute to the campaign by sharing their own extraordinary WA moments using the hashtag #justanotherdayinWA.\" In 2016, more than 17 films presenting personal experiences in WA will be created along with other supporting materials including photography and a microsite.\u00a0 Many more films will be produced over the life of the campaign. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the campaign would further enhance regional WA's position as a desirable tourism destination. The campaign is partly funded by Royalties for Regions under the Regional Tourism Marketing Program, which forms an important part of the State Government's strategy to grow the value of tourism to $12 billion by 2020. \"Tourism is a major contributor to the State's economy.\u00a0 In 2015, visitors spent $9 billion in the State, including $4 billion in regional areas,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Just Another Day in WA marketing campaign will bring significant social and economic benefits throughout Western Australia.\" Premier and Tourism Minister's office - 6552 5000 Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700",

Bowler of the Year Awards for an outstanding season went to Noelene Abe of Corrigin, who received the Connie Hicks Brooch; and the Rosenthal Medal went to Tom Mitchell from Manning.  Other award winners were Robert Gibbons of the Gosnells Bowling Club (Volunteer of the Year); Ken Perks from the Morley Bowling Club (Coach of the Year); Tammin and Albany (Small Country Club and Country Club of the Year) and their metropolitan counterparts in Mundaring and Sorrento. \"Across the State, there are nearly 16,000 members of all ages who belong to 207 bowling clubs, all enjoying a sport which is keeping them active and connected,\" Ms Davies said. Bowls receives $150,000 annually in Organisational Sustainability Program funding from the Liberal National Government through the Department of Sport and Recreation. Since 2008, bowling clubs across WA have received more than $14 million in facilities funding through the Community Sporting and Recreation Facilities Fund.\u00a0  Minister's office - 6552 5500",

Speaking at the event, organised by Celebrate WA, Mr Barnett said WA Day was not only about looking forward, but also recognising Aboriginal and subsequent settlement of WA and the enormous contribution migrants had made to the State. \"WA's history dates back more than 40,000 years, with the first inhabitants of the South-West being the Noongar people,\" he said. \"Recently, State Parliament passed the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Bill 2015, which formally recognises the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West.  \"It is significant that the Bill will be proclaimed on June 6, 2016, which this year will be WA Day. \"This is a historic occasion and an achievement of which the Liberal National Government is proud.\u00a0 It embodies the spirit of the WA Day holiday.\" The Premier encouraged West Australians to enjoy some of the major events being held across the State over the long weekend.\u00a0 These included a WA Day Festival at Elizabeth Quay on Monday, featuring free family activities such as WA's best burger cook-off and workshops with Western Australian sport stars. Family activities would also be held at Esplanade Park in Fremantle and at the Western Australian Museum in Albany, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\u00a0 Port Hedland and Mandurah were also hosting festivals.

The Western Australian Exim Corporation Limited was established and tasked with targeting Middle Eastern and Asian export markets and, in a sign of things to come, approval was given to install 2,600 computers in primary and secondary schools.

Future events at Elizabeth Quay will include the Swan Festival of Lights and the World Masters Athletics Championships welcoming ceremony, featuring thousands of athletes from around the globe.

Gage Roads' Little Dove (draught) was awarded Champion Australian Beer at the awards, the world's largest annual beer competition judging both packaged and draught beer.\u00a0 Little Dove was also named Best New World Style Pale Ale. Racing and Gaming Minister Colin Holt said a panel of 63 beer industry experts judged the beers over three days, with Gage Roads coming up trumps.  \"Named after the famous sea channel between Fremantle and Rottnest Island, Gage Roads is a quintessential Western Australian business built on the foundation of an idea and a tonne of hard work,\" Mr Holt said.  \"From humble beginnings as an independent Western Australian brewery, Gage Roads has grown to become one of the largest independent brewers in Australia - and now a national champion.\u00a0 I would like to congratulate the entire Gage Roads team on their success.\"  The Gage Roads victory comes hot on the heels of Albany's Limeburners Distillery being announced Australian Distiller of the Year in April. \"Apart from the best beaches, wine and weather, these awards prove WA is also a nation-leader in brewing and distilling,\" the Minister said.  Mr Holt said the State Government was making it easier for Western Australian brewers to do business.  \"Our changes under the Liquor Legislation Amendment Act 2015 enabled beer producers to sell their product for consumption - not just tasting - on a licensed premise between 10am and 10pm,\" he said. \"Beer, wine and spirit producers also benefit from the removal of restrictions that prohibit them from taking sales via telephone or the internet from an office not located on their licensed premises.\" Beer and wine producers can now also establish a second cellar door operation or collective cellar door with other producers within the same region off-site. \"It will ultimately provide producers greater flexibility while also driving tourism outcomes and meeting consumer demand,\" the Minister said.

Launching Western Power's winter storm campaign in Jandakot today, Energy Minister Mike Nahan reminded householders to be vigilant, given unpruned trees and household debris caused the majority of electricity outages during the winter months.  \"More than 60 per cent of electricity outages during a storm are caused by tree branches hitting powerlines and debris being blown into the electricity grid, and a significant number of these outages can be avoided,\" Dr Nahan said. \"Western Power is busy preparing for the winter weather by trimming trees on public land, but I'd like to remind people that trees and shrubs on private land are their responsibility. \"The mild winter last year was a welcome relief for our emergency crews, but that shouldn't be a reason for home owners to be complacent heading in to this year's winter storm season.\" According to the Bureau of Meteorology, severe winter fronts hit Perth and the South-West every year, with the metropolitan area hit with an average of 12 days with winds exceeding 90 kilometres an hour. During June, July and August, Western Power receives an average of 200,000 calls from members of the public reporting faults, including fallen powerlines, vehicle accidents and winter tornados. \"Check the trees on your property and make sure the branches are at least 2.5 metres from powerlines.\u00a0 If you think trees near powerlines need trimming, we recommend you hire a professional tree pruner to do the job as safely as possible,\" the Minister said. \"If you see a fallen powerline or network hazard, stay well away and call Western Power's 24/7 emergency line on 13 13 51.\"  Minister's office - 6552 5700 ",

Spare Parts Puppet Theatre was formed following the success of Faust and Ms Nishimoto was invited to spend a year working with the company as a master puppeteer and technique master. She stayed on to become an Australian citizen and performed and trained other performers both within the company and through master classes across Australia's capital cities.\u00a0 She toured with the company through Australia, China, Korea, Japan, Canada and the United States of America. Ms Nishimoto was recognised in 2008 by the global Union internationale de la Marionnette for her contribution to puppetry in Australia. Among her productions were The Bugalugs Bum Thief, Cat Balloon, The Deep, Eat the Moon and the large-scale The Midnight Gang in collaboration with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra.\u00a0 Her recent projects included Moominpappa at Sea and The Fox.  \"Noriko was an exceptional talent and she will be sadly missed by Western Australian audiences and the arts sector,\" the Minister said.

The new synthetic hockey turf was made possible in part through the State Government's Community Sporting and Recreation Facilities Fund's (CSRFF) contribution of $146,692. The total cost of the turf resurfacing was about $423,000, with the Upper Great Southern Hockey Association contributed the remaining $276,000. \"The new turf has enhanced the quality and status of hockey in the region and we look forward to seeing more big events here, given it has been resurfaced to international standards,\" the Minister said.  The two games in Narrogin this weekend are the Kookaburras' final home warm-ups before the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\u00a0 Two games will be held in Narrogin on May 21 and May 22, with a final game in Perth on Tuesday, May 24. \"Narrogin is a regional hockey powerhouse and it's an exciting opportunity for local fans to see a couple of world-class games on home turf and watch their heroes play,\" Ms Davies said. \"I hope these games inspire those locals involved in hockey - or thinking about becoming involved - as it's a wonderful sport to keep you fit, healthy and engaged with the community.\"\u00a0  The Kookaburras' next engagement is in London for the 2016 men's hockey Champions Trophy (June 10-17), with the final Rio squad being decided soon afterwards.

The 2016-17 State Budget has provided an extra $22.1 million, including $10.09 million from Royalties for Regions, to Kimberley marine and national parks, including the creation of the Great Kimberley Marine Park, the Kimberley National Park and Horizontal Falls. The investment is part of the State Government's Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy, which now has a commitment of $103.6 million to protect the region's unique assets. Premier and Tourism and Science Minister Colin Barnett said the Great Kimberley Marine Park would cover more than three million hectares and would solidify the State as one of the world's greatest ecotourism destinations. \"The strategy recognises the Kimberley region can be a world-class, ecotourism destination to rival the likes of the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu National Park,\" Mr Barnett said.  \"Investing in the creation of parks ensures ecotourism can be developed and marketed with certainty and the outstanding natural values on which they are based are conserved forever.\"  Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the parks would be jointly managed with traditional owners and would help to support new business and job opportunities for Aboriginal people. \"Preserving our unique plants, animals and natural features is critical to our economic development and job creation,\" Mr Jacob said. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said investing in science and conservation had a clear ecotourism benefit, creating economic opportunities for WA's regions. \"Conservation and ecotourism is an important investment for Royalties for Regions as it attracts investment and creates business and job opportunities for regional communities,\" Mr Redman said. The creation of the new marine reserves will increase the total area of the State's marine parks and reserves from about 1.5 million hectares to more than five million hectares since the Liberal National Government came to office in 2008, representing a 200 per cent increase.

It will include alfresco dining and casual seating, water features and public art, and heritage elements recognising the historic usage of the former railway shunting yard site including a 'ceremonial' railway line.

Officially opening the $14.1 million project today, State Development Minister Bill Marmion said the road would guarantee access to the town, even in cyclonic conditions. \"This is important infrastructure for the growing Onslow community, giving certainty to locals and visitors to the area,\" Mr Marmion said. Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the road and surrounding works were especially important because they provided all-weather access between the town centre and the recently upgraded Onslow Airport. \"Following cyclones, the previous road was prone to flooding from storm surges which hampered emergency services and prevented evacuations from occurring,\" Mr Nalder said. \"To overcome this seasonal problem, the new road is constructed on an elevated alignment.\" The Onslow Ring Road project involved construction of 3.5 kilometres of new highway, including new intersections and remedial works on the existing Onslow Road.  Mr Marmion said the works were funded by the Chevron-operated Wheatstone Project, a major liquefied natural gas venture located 12km west of the town. \"After extensive planning, new and upgraded facilities are being constructed, including the Onslow Shire Council administration centre and library, wastewater treatment plant improvements and housing for regional government officers,\" he said.

The history of the Guildford has been woven into the restored hotel with original tiles, fireplaces, doors and windows retained.\u00a0 Giant jarrah roof beams and charred convict-made bricks have become features of the refurbished hotel. \"I congratulate the owner and the Publican Group for taking on the conservation and refurbishment of Guildford Hotel, sensitively adapting and returning this heritage asset to the community,\" Mr Jacob said.

Disability Services Minister Donna Faragher awarded the $40,000 Disability Services Commission grant today and said the results from the Curtin University study would demonstrate how technology helped people with disability and could potentially shape future urban design. \"The project will look at how people with disability are using smartphones to travel around suburbs, towns and cities,\" Mrs Faragher said. \"This might include using a smartphone app to locate accessible taxi ranks or a local government's ACROD parking map to plan their journey.\" The research project will collect data from four people in three separate locations - Curtin University, Perth and Bunbury.\u00a0 Two participants will be wheelchair users and the other two will be vision impaired. The Minister said a new app would be developed to track and map the participants' movements from their smartphones' global positioning system. \"The app will regularly capture the participants' phone use to see how mobile devices and apps are becoming an integral part of how people with disability travel around in urban spaces,\" she said. Mrs Faragher said the project's findings would be used to educate and inform local governments, disability service providers and allied health professionals on how accessibility of the urban environment could be improved for people with disability.

Lands Minister Terry Redman today announced the final drafting of legislation to deliver land tenure reform to the State's Rangelands, following months of consultation and feedback. Changes to the proposed legislation as a direct result of feedback includes creating a new role of industry advocate and an industry review panel to provide the Minister for Lands with independent advice on land condition issues relating to individual leases.\u00a0  \"The new model gives lessees access to the type of representation they have not had before - the industry advocate will be available to lessees and may be able to provide advice that stops an emerging land condition issue from becoming too serious,\" Mr Redman said.  \"If the Minister is faced with making an adverse decision, a panel of three people chosen by industry will provide their advice, which the Government must take into account.\u00a0 The State Government is listening to Rangelands stakeholders so we can deliver a draft Bill into State Parliament that addresses their concerns and needs for the future.\" The Minister said a new type of land tenure, known as a Rangelands lease, would form part of the legislation, and would be an option for pastoralists wishing to diversify their property.\u00a0 The legislation also included a proposed statutory right of renewal for compliant pastoral leases and the ability to transfer permits with a pastoral lease.\u00a0\u00a0  \"The proposed draft Land Administration Amendment Bill 2016 is designed to help improve security of tenure for pastoral lessees, increase the value of pastoral leases, allow for more diverse land uses and unlock the potential of the Rangelands,\" he said. More than 320 people attended stakeholder forums as part of the Rangelands public consultation in Perth, Carnarvon, Broome, Fitzroy Crossing, Halls Creek, Mount Magnet, Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Port Hedland in April 2016.\u00a0 In addition, more than 30 people attended an Aboriginal consultation forum in Derby organised with the help of the Winun Ngari Aboriginal Corporation. It is expected the draft Bill will be introduced into State Parliament next month. Minister's office - 6552 6700 ",

Releasing the whole-of-government Digital WA strategy today, Innovation Minister Bill Marmion said it was a practical vision to give West Australians easier access to quality services, whenever and wherever it was convenient for them. \"Imagine having secure and relevant State Government services available through a single web portal anywhere, anytime and on any device - your computer, mobile phone or tablet - without the need to attend or call a Government office,\" Mr Marmion said. \"From simply paying bills online to obtaining the latest information and data on everything Government that matters to you, that is the Digital WA promise once fully implemented. \"Digital WA will also help entrepreneurs and start-up companies flourish, as they use Government open data sources to produce new products and services to meet the evolving needs of the community.\" The Minister said the Digital WA strategy would guide those changes over the next four years. \"Our ICT bywords are innovation, collaboration and transformation and work has already started to ensure the success of the strategy,\" he said \"In November last year, I launched the GovNext-ICT initiative which will improve how Government agencies pay for, and use, technology across the public sector. \"GovNext-ICT helps agencies to migrate into the cloud, reduces the cost of running and maintaining systems, and connects all agencies into a single Government-wide network, enabling synergies to be realised that were previously impossible.\" Mr Marmion said Digital WA aimed to curb growth in the State Government's current $1 to $2 billion annual ICT spend. \"The targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the strategy are ambitious, but reflect the Government's strong commitment to delivering enhanced digital services to West Australians,\" he said.  \"One of these KPIs is to have 75 per cent of all Government-related transactions completed online by the public by 2020.\" With the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer leading the collaboration across the State's more than 100 agencies, the shift to common platforms and the leveraging of cloud services will enable agencies to be more agile and responsive to the changing needs of the community.\u00a0  The Minister said the public was increasingly comfortable with online information and transactions. \"The Digital WA strategy will accelerate the pace of digital transformation across the public sector, which will ultimately benefit all West Australians in accessing and using Government services,\" he said.

Dr Nahan said four customers across five properties had taken up the opportunity to partner with Horizon Power in the WA-first project after more than 320 power poles and hundreds of kilometres of powerlines were destroyed in the bushfires.  \"I commend Horizon Power for identifying that we could offer these customers a solar-powered, stand-alone power system, which incorporates battery technology and is not connected to the grid,\" he said. \"This is a WA-first project offering an innovative solution for customers instead of rebuilding this part of the network, which is more susceptible to adverse weather and other causes of power interruptions.  \"These customers - including the Lockes - are pioneers of these new systems, which will be owned and operated by Horizon Power.\u00a0 The customers will pay the same cost for their electricity supplied by these units as they did previously for power supplied by poles and wires.  \"While the units won't be connected to the network, customers will receive the same service, including being able to call and rely on Horizon Power to respond to any unplanned power interruptions.\"  The Minister said Horizon Power was working to identify other potential sites where stand-alone power systems could be a viable alternative to connecting to, or maintaining or replacing, the overhead network across its service area.

During this stage, in collaboration with the Shire of Coolgardie, local people will have the opportunity to contribute to the proposed plans and longer-term solutions through a consultation process.

    "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett has officially opened the new Mills Park Community Centre in the City of Gosnells, made possible by $8 million in State Government grants. The community centre is part of the Mills Park redevelopment, a district hub catering to community, sport and recreation activities with specialist facilities to accommodate local groups.  Mr Barnett said the infrastructure project was the largest the city had ever undertaken and would increase social, leisure and recreational opportunities for the local community, while preserving the park's natural assets. \"I congratulate the City of Gosnells for developing an outstanding community hub which brings state-of-the-art recreation, community and sporting facilities to the area,\" he said. \"The Mills Park redevelopment received $4 million in funding through a Lotterywest grant, and a further $4 million through the Department of Sport and Recreation.\" At the heart of Mills Park is the community centre. The building is Western Australia's first 6-Star Green Star public building and includes a community hall, function centre, meeting rooms, multi-purpose activity spaces, club rooms, cafe, change rooms, public amenities and a kindy gym.  \"This outstanding building demonstrates not only a commitment to bringing a growing community together, but also to sustainable building practices,\" the Premier said. Sport and Recreation Minister Mia Davies said the city received a grant of $2 million from the Community Sporting and Recreation Facilities Fund in 2014-15 and an extra $2 million in the 2015-16 forward planning round.  \"This money is going towards a wide range of sporting facilities at Mills Park including tennis courts, two reconfigured playing fields, floodlighting, cricket nets, two multi-purpose synthetic soccer fields, a skate park and change rooms, plus a contribution to the sporting clubrooms in the Mills Park Community Centre,\" Ms Davies said. Along with the community centre, the Mills Park redevelopment also includes a skate plaza, nature play space, piazza, sporting infrastructure and walkways.\u00a0 The piazza, which features a stage area and viewing space, will be a venue for events and festivals in the city.  The fully accessible nature play space is five times larger than was available previously and connects to a network of well-lit walkways to provide further opportunities for the community to connect with the natural environment.  The site also includes the State's first full-size artificial soccer pitches which are home to two local clubs. Mr Barnett acknowledged the hard work of the City of Gosnells in working collaboratively with residents to develop a recreation space that would provide for a connected community.  \"Extensive consultation will ensure these facilities meet the needs of the city and will be enjoyed by the local community for many years to come,\" he said. The Mills Park Master Plan was finalised in December 2014, with construction beginning in April 2015.\u00a0 Stage 2 began in November 2015 with an expected completion date of February 2017, four months ahead of schedule.  The total cost of the redevelopment is $47 million with Lotterywest and the Department of Sport and Recreation each providing $4 million and the City of Gosnells contributing the balance.

Health Minister John Day said the innovative new Pingelly Health Centre would provide enhanced primary and community care facilities, including 24/7 emergency care. \"The primary health centre at Pingelly will bring together healthcare providers focused on the promotion of good health, the prevention and early detection of illness and the management of chronic disease to help people stay well and out of hospitals,\" Mr Day said. The facility will include an emergency department with ambulance bays and Emergency Telehealth Service videoconferencing facilities.\u00a0 There will also be four multi-purpose consulting rooms enabled with telehealth and group therapy rooms to deliver a range of health services including physiotherapy, occupational speech therapy, child health, mental health and community-based aged-care services.\u00a0  The centre will also have general practice consultation rooms and treatment spaces allowing for co-ordinated patient care between the local GP and other health professionals. The designs by Oldfield Knott Architects for the new Pingelly Health Centre are a result of extensive planning by WA Country Health Service Wheatbelt staff and local community members.\u00a0\u00a0 A local project user group was established to drive community input into the design of the facility and the services to be provided. \"The result is a visionary design, including pavilion-style pitched roofs and Salmon Gum coloured face bricks.\u00a0 The 25kW solar panels that have been incorporated onto the roof will save around $10,000 per year in electricity costs,\" Mr Day said. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said investment in health infrastructure was fundamental to the ongoing growth of regional Western Australia. \"The new, purpose-built facility will support a contemporary health service and bring improvements in patient care,\" Mr Redman said.  \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions is enhancing the delivery of sustainable services that meet the current and future healthcare demands of our regional communities.\"  Construction is scheduled to start in the third quarter of 2016 and be completed by early 2018.

Mr L'Estrange said the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) had issued more than 17,000 Miner's Rights prospecting   in Western Australia in the past five years. \"The issuing of more than 17,000 permits shows the growing popularity of gold prospecting in the State, however safety should always be a prospector's number one priority,\" he said.  \"WA's outback can be a harsh, remote environment, which is why personal safety is such an important consideration when prospecting.\" Mr L'Estrange urged all prospectors to carry Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) when in remote areas. \"PLBs are the best way of avoiding what can be a tragic outcome of getting lost in the Goldfields and the outback.\u00a0 If you're not carrying a beacon, you're not taking enough responsibility for your life,\" he said.  \"Four years ago, a month-long search ended in tragedy and sparked the push for PLBs.\u00a0 In contrast, a search conducted last year found the missing person just four hours after his device began sending out signals.\" The device, which can be purchased from most outdoor stores, is ideal for use in remote areas as it does not rely on telecommunication networks to submit a signal. Deputy Premier and Police Minister Liza Harvey said of the land searches conducted in WA in 2015, there were six for missing prospectors.  \"The land searches included four in the Goldfields-Esperance District and two in the Mid West-Gascoyne District,\" Mrs Harvey said.\u00a0  \"We have had tragic outcomes in the past after people have become lost.\u00a0 The choice to carry a beacon should be an easy one for prospectors.\" The Seven Golden Rules for prospecting are: Mines and Petroleum Minister's office - 6552 6900 Deputy Premier and Police Minister's office - 6552 5900",

The investment will be made possible by the Government's Royalties for Regions program from 2017-18. Mines and Petroleum Minister Sean L'Estrange said given the current economic climate and where Western Australia sat in the commodities cycle, continued investment through the EIS was essential to encourage exploration. \"Ultimately we will be finding new deposits, leading to the mines of the future and jobs for future generations,\" Mr L'Estrange said.  \"The exploration stage of the mining cycle is high risk and the scheme freely provides valuable pre-competitive regional geoscience and commodity information to help reduce the technical and financial risks for companies laying the foundations of more discoveries.\" The EIS has been funded for a total of $130 million since 2009 and consists of a number of programs focused on the regions, including the highly successful Co-funded Exploration Drilling Program. WA's global profile as an attractive destination for investment has also been boosted by the scheme, including being ranked in the Fraser Institute Survey of Mining Companies 2015 as the most attractive jurisdiction in the world for exploration and mining investment.\u00a0  Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment in the EIS would support the long-term sustainability of regional WA.  \"Exploration activity stimulated by the scheme provides opportunities for direct and indirect jobs and prospects for business development,\" Mr Redman said.  \"Royalties for Regions is investing in a sustainable economic future for regional WA and I look forward to seeing the flow-on benefits to our regional communities.\"\u00a0\u00a0  Mr L'Estrange said the discovery of the Nova nickel deposit and the recommencement of mining at Mount Magnet were among the success stories of co-funded deep exploration drilling. \"Achievements like these ensure that for the long-term WA's resources sector will continue to underpin the State's economy which will benefit all West Australians,\" he said.

    "statement": "Liberal National Government funding of $400,000 over four years will help Busselton's internationally renowned population health study - celebrating its 50th anniversary this year - solve more mysteries about the health impact of genetics. Visiting the study centre in Busselton today, Health Minister John Day highlighted the latest respiratory research results, which indicate people's basic lung function and how they react to environmental influences such as smoking and disease, are controlled by different genes. \"This type of research is exactly why the State Government supports this globally significant population health study,\" Mr Day said. \"Results like these promise to tease out the specific genes which determine how our lungs develop from conception, and others that control their reaction to outside influences in later life. \"These findings will help tailor future treatment in individual patients, by allowing doctors to use genetic tests to determine and minimise risks. The information could also prove vital for preventative medicine. \"The overwhelming message from this latest research is that promoting health is something we need to be mindful of throughout life, from the unborn child to old age.\" Some of the Government funding will be used to recall and remeasure participants in the long-running Busselton Baby Boomer Study which is investigating the impact of multiple illnesses on physical and mental wellbeing. \"This project, which began as an initiative of local GP, the late Kevin Cullen, is one of the longest-running longitudinal studies in the world and has made an enormous contribution to international health and medical research,\" the Minister said. \"Since it began in 1966, it has attracted some of our leading researchers and more than 25,000 participants, with many of its initial cohort still involved in surveys today. \"That it began when Busselton was a still a holiday and retirement destination with a population of little more than 6,000 people - and yet is still going strong today - is a credit to the researchers, participants and community of Busselton.\" Until the Government made permanent premises available to the study in 2005 - leading to continuous survey activity - much of the study's early data was collected by researchers travelling to Busselton from Perth every three years. \"The researchers would stay about three months at a time and operate from makeshift laboratories set up in tents, caravans or spares room in the homes of locals,\" Mr Day said. \"Busselton locals were so proud and supportive of their study they even organised lamington drives and other grassroots fundraising activities to supplement its shoestring budget.  \"It was this determination, resourcefulness and unwavering commitment of researchers, participants and the Busselton community that has seen the study defy all odds to become the jewel in the crown of Western Australian health research data.\" Data and biospecimens from the Busselton Health Study have contributed to research around the world in areas as diverse as healthy ageing, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, sleep apnoea and thyroid disease. It has also been instrumental in key scientific findings, including: During his visit, the Minister met retired building inspector Bert Johnson, who has been involved in the study's surveys since the beginning.  Mr Day said it was the generosity of people such as Mr Johnson that had made the study such a success. Minister's office - 6552 6200",

Inspecting the advanced Nauti-Craft technology today, Innovation Minister Bill Marmion said the marine start-up company was an outstanding example of Western Australian ingenuity with global commercial applications. Nauti-Craft Pty Ltd is a research and development company focused on the design and development of hydraulic suspension system technology for multi-hulled vessels. \"Nauti-Craft was founded by Chris Heyring, who also started Kinetic Pty Ltd, another Dunsborough-based small business which invented automotive suspension systems now used by major car makers, including Toyota and Nissan,\" Mr Marmion said. \"This new company is now adapting this suspension system to the marine environment, enabling vessels to react rapidly to changing ocean conditions. \"This innovation promises widespread applications and the company already has strong links with the European renewable energy sector. The United Kingdom-based Carbon Trust is helping fund the research and development, looking towards rolling out the technology on vessels servicing the offshore wind farm industry in Europe.\" The technology has been licensed to a major vessel supplier to the European offshore wind farm market and also to a Middle Eastern luxury boat builder. \"Nauti-Craft is an example of a regional Western Australian company taking advantage of opportunities in the global market and shows us that in today's world, isolation is no barrier to commercialising innovation and supporting Western Australian jobs,\" the Minister said. \"The Liberal National Government's network of international trade and investment offices works with companies such as Nauti-Craft to help Western Australian entrepreneurs export their technology and services. \"Capitalising on this network will form an important part of the rollout of the $20 million innovation package announced in the recent State Budget.\" Minister's office - 6552 6800",

Announcing the latest round of Recreational Boating Facilities Scheme (RBFS) grants, Transport Minister Dean Nalder said 20 projects located from Wyndham to Walpole would receive a share of $1.49 million. \"The biggest single grant of the round was $171,750 to the City of Busselton for the redevelopment of the boat trailer parking layout at Port Geographe Boat Marina,\" Mr Nalder said. \"The Shire of Gingin received two grants totalling $204,028 to enable an upgrade of the foreshore boat launching facility at Guilderton, including a new finger jetty, and improved trailer parking to streamline the boat launching process. \"Boating is a popular pastime in WA, with nearly 100,000 registered recreational craft throughout the State. \"The RBFS, which fosters partnerships with local governments and authorities, is extremely successful in helping to meet the needs of WA's growing boating community.\"  The scheme is managed by the Department of Transport and provides up to 75 per cent of funding for new or improved facilities which benefit the recreational boating public.  Eligible authorities may also apply for planning grants which result in detailed plans, cost estimates, approvals or similar for public recreational boating facilities. The Minister said 20 of the 26 applicants in the latest grants round had been successful in securing funding, with 15 of the 20 projects located in regional WA. \n    Minister's office - 6552 6400 \n\n\u00a0",

Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment in DairyCare was an important step to protect and support waterways and regional estuaries by helping a valued industry to become more sustainable.  \"DairyCare will investigate innovative options for improving dairy effluent management and provide farmers with information, incentives and the tools to make better decisions about fertiliser use and effluent management,\" Mr Redman said.

The publication is one part of the Restoration Seedbank Initiative, a $5 million research partnership between the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, BHP Billiton Iron Ore and The University of Western Australia. The initiative focuses on achieving better results in seed storage and expanding Kings Park's seed research capacity to improve the ability to germinate and grow seeds for restoration. The research is developing new technologies, including coating seeds in polymer or clay-based mixes to aid germination and survival in a process called seed pelleting.\u00a0 This is helping to improve the industry average of just five per cent survival rate for seeds used in restoration.

Transport Minister Dean Nalder said Toodyay Road was a crucial east-west connection between Midland and Toodyay which carried more than 4,000 vehicles daily. \"The completion of the $5 million project, funded through the Liberal National Government's Safer Roads Program, will ensure the road is safer for the drivers and passengers in those vehicles, as well as local residents and businesses,\" he said. \"The improvements have been designed to reduce the likelihood of head-on or right-angle crashes, and will allow safer and easier access to roadside homes and other properties.\" Mr Nalder said key features of the completed $5 million project included: Deputy Premier and Road Safety Minister Liza Harvey said the next stage of the Toodyay Road safety upgrade, from Noble Falls east to Aspen Road, was now underway and expected to be completed by July 2016. \"The $3 million stage 2 project stemmed from the inaugural Wheatbelt Highway Safety Review and was funded by the Road Trauma Trust Account in the 2016-17 State Budget,\" she said. \"The project will improve safety by widening and sealing road shoulders, installing safety barriers and upgrading signposts.\"  Mrs Harvey said a record $146 million had been allocated from the Road Trauma Trust Account in 2016-17, of which nearly $8 million was to fund recommendations from the Wheatbelt Highway Safety Review.

Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett said securing the championships, commonly known as the 'Aussies', was a great economic and tourism coup for Western Australia. \"When the championships were last held at Scarborough in 2014, it attracted nearly 8,000 visitors who spent $12.4 million during the seven days of the event,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We're hoping to see another great turnout and economic boost when the championships return in 2018.\" The Premier said hosting events such as the 2018 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships formed an important part of the State Government's strategy to increase the value of tourism to $12 billion by 2020. \"In 2015, visitors to WA spent $9 billion and we want to see that figure reach $12 billion over the next five years,\" he said. \"Events will help us reach that target as they add vibrancy to the State, attract visitors and help raise the profile of WA through media exposure.\" Deputy Premier Liza Harvey said the nationally televised Aussies would be the perfect way to show off the revitalised Scarborough Beach to the rest of Australia. \"Scarborough Beach is an important coastal tourism precinct because of its natural beauty and has the highest concentration of accommodation in the metropolitan area outside the CBD,\" Mrs Harvey said. \"The State Government has invested $48 million in revitalising Scarborough to help transform it into a world-class destination and tourist hotspot.\u00a0 With the public works being largely completed by the 2018 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships, the timing couldn't be better.\" Premier and Tourism Minister's office - 6552 5000 Deputy Premier's office - 6552 5900",

The new building will provide a hub to support families, individuals and young people in Midland and surrounding areas accessing vital social services.  Mr Barnett said the building would enable the organisation to deliver professional social services in the north-east metropolitan region. \"The establishment of a modern social service centre in Midland will ensure the local community is able to access important services including counselling, family and adolescent mediation, family therapy and support programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders,\" he said.  Centrecare has been operating in Western Australia since the 1940s and offers community services including professional counselling, support, mediation and training.  In order to maximise immediate benefits to the local community, other complementary service providers will be housed in the building.  \"Centrecare has shown foresight by creating a building which will bring together local service providers, making it easier for people to access a number of services in one building,\" the Premier said. The building will also provide training and meeting rooms which will be available for use by local organisations.  Mr Barnett said the building demonstrated Centrecare's commitment to Midland as a growing urban centre and the wider community.\u00a0 It had been designed to allow for future growth and meet the growing need for support services.

Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the recovery of the woylie, a small marsupial, was a part of the Liberal National Government's Western Shield wildlife conservation program, which was working to reduce the threat of foxes and feral cats on native animals. About half the woylies have been taken to Australian Wildlife Conservancy's (AWC) wildlife sanctuaries at Mount Gibson, 350km north of Perth, and Karakamia at Chidlow, about 50km north-east of Perth.\u00a0 The remaining woylies have been transported to Dryandra Woodland, near Narrogin in the Wheatbelt region. The woylies moved to AWC properties have been released in feral predator-free sanctuaries to supplement animals that were moved to these sites in 2015, while the animals moved to Dryandra have added to the wild population there and increased the genetic diversity of this important population. \"The Perup Sanctuary supports the most genetically diverse woylie population in the State and this transfer of the marsupials is part of conservation efforts focused on establishing insurance populations across a range of locations,\" Mr Jacob said. The woylie population is estimated to be less than 20,000 in Australia, including 400 to 600 of the marsupials in the Perup Sanctuary, with the only wild populations remaining in Dryandra and the Upper Warren in the State's south-west.  The Minister said genetic diversity of woylies at Perup and in the wild made them the most important in Australia. \"These wild populations remain vulnerable to predation by foxes and cats and potential disease outbreaks,\" he said. \"The partnership between Parks and Wildlife and AWC enables us to increase our capacity to conserve wildlife while also, and most importantly, increasing the number of populations of a critically endangered species.\" Minister's office - 6552 5800",

The project, which will generate about 20 jobs, is being funded by the Liberal National Government's Bridge Safety Improvement Program.

    "statement": "Racing and Gaming Minister Colin Holt has extended the ban on liquor in the remote Aboriginal community of Wangkatjungka in the Fitzroy Valley.  The ban, which was implemented under section 175(1a) of the Liquor Control Act 1988, was introduced in 2008 and prohibits people from possessing and transporting liquor into the community. \"The Wangkatjungka community were pioneers as the first liquor-restricted area declared in Western Australia, after a request from community leaders in 2008,\" Mr Holt said.  \"Since that time, the community has experienced improved safety and security for its residents. The feedback I have received indicates the majority of people at Wangkatjungka are in favour of the alcohol ban being extended. \"These restrictions, which are fully supported by police and health authorities, have positively impacted the lives of people living in the community and, as a result, I have agreed to extend them for a further three years.\" The restrictions apply to an area of more than 270 hectares encompassing the Wangkatjungka community and will now be in place until April 22, 2019. The Minister said excessive alcohol consumption had a link to domestic violence across the Fitzroy Valley and WA Police were able to use the liquor restrictions as an effective tool in ensuring alcohol-driven issues were better managed within the community.  \"The restrictions also give the community itself the ability to control behaviour and reduce incidents of violence and antisocial behaviour,\" he said.  \"I am told local police are working with the Kurungal Council, which has applied for crime prevention funding to start their own community patrols enforcing liquor restrictions. This is an encouraging development.\"  Penalties for breaches of the regulations range from $2,000 for an individual to $5,000 for a licensee or manager. Minister's office - 6552 6100",

Opening the ward today, Health Minister John Day said the Liberal National Government was meeting the need for extended services in the rapidly growing region, where the population was expected to exceed 500,000 by 2020. \"The completion of this project means more children will be able to access medical treatment sooner and closer to home,\" Mr Day said.  \"One of the most important features of the ward is the inclusion of a 10-bed Day Procedure Unit.\u00a0 Previously, children needing a day procedure such as allergy desensitisation, removal of adenoids, correcting squints and other general surgery would be cared for in an overnight bed. \"Having dedicated beds for day procedures means more overnight beds will be available for children needing longer-stay care, which will help reduce waiting lists. \"The other significant change is that 20 of the rooms on the new ward are single rooms, compared with only two on the former paediatric ward.\" The Minister said more than 23,000 children presented to the Joondalup Health Campus emergency department in 2015 - representing 20 per cent of all metropolitan paediatric attendances and a 60 per cent jump on five years ago - and more than 3,000 children were admitted to the hospital's paediatric ward. \"This impressive new ward is world-class and has been built with features and capacity that will help future-proof the hospital as the population continues to grow,\" he said. \"The ward includes a treatment area for blood to be taken and other procedures to be carried out, away from the bed the child occupies which is reserved as a 'safe and pain-free' space where they can feel relaxed. \"We are mindful of the fact that being in hospital can be an overwhelming experience, so a lot of thought and careful planning has gone into making this ward a friendly place designed to enhance the comfort of children and their parents.\" Other special features of the new ward include: Construction of the new paediatric unit was jointly funded by the State Government ($3.1 million), Telethon ($6 million) and Ramsay Health Care ($3 million) and employed more than 500 people during construction.

    "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett today announced that the new $1.2 billion Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) would begin treating its first patients in late October 2016. \"Perth Children's Hospital will be a world-class paediatric centre with modern facilities, advanced technologies and new ways of working, which will bring enormous benefits for patients, families and staff,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We made a decision very early in our first term of Government that we would build a new children's hospital to serve the community well into the next century.\u00a0 It was always a priority over the construction of a new stadium. \"This is a direct benefit of the State's period of economic prosperity after changes in 2010 to 11 Iron Ore State Agreements held by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto allowed the Liberal National Government to allocate $350 million towards PCH. \"It is planned for the first outpatient clinics to start on October 24, followed by the start of selected day surgery from November 7, with the final patient move from Princess Margaret Hospital for Children planned for Sunday, November 20. \"This is an exciting milestone which highlights the State Government's clear commitment to improve health outcomes for our children, now and into the future. \"Although commissioning such an advanced hospital is a challenging task, the Government has delivered many new hospitals in recent years and that considerable experience is being used to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.\" Health Minister John Day said it was important to schedule key commissioning target dates. \"This ensures appropriate and accurate planning for the transition period because all equipment, systems and treatment processes must be repeatedly tested before we begin treating our young patients at the new facility,\" Mr Day said.  \"The hospital opening will be a tremendous achievement, with PCH forming the centre of a network of new and expanded facilities for children and families that we have built across the State.  \"We will not compromise safety, and the hospital will only accept patients on the planned dates if construction and commissioning activities are complete and the move can be done safely.\" The Premier said he was pleased to see the significant progress in construction which had meant commissioning and moving plans could be finalised. \"It has been a very complex project, however the result is a world-class facility all West Australians can be proud of,\" he said. \"The hospital is on track for building handover in August, however many areas such as intensive care and operating theatres are already being accessed by PCH commissioning team staff.\" Princess Margaret Hospital for Children will remain open as the State's only dedicated paediatric hospital and major trauma centre until the final patient move to PCH.

Regional Development and Lands Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government investment would have a significant and lasting impact on the traditional business, entertainment and retail centre of Broome. The project consists of improvements such as major upgrades to Carnarvon Street and Dampier Terrace, as well as feasibility and technical studies for projects including a cultural centre, the extension of Gray Street and the reconnection of Chinatown to Roebuck Bay. \"Chinatown has a rich multicultural and industrial history which presents unique opportunities for growth of the town centre through projects that will boost the economic potential for local businesses and the retail and tourism sectors,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Shire of Broome and LandCorp will deliver the Chinatown Revitalisation project in partnership with the Kimberley Development Commission, building on this vibrant precinct that highlights its continuing strong Aboriginal cultural heritage and pearling history. \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions provides substantial investment to regional communities, ensuring they continue to thrive socially and economically.\" The project will receive extra investment including $2 million from the Shire of Broome and $600,000 from the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure program, a Federal Government-funded initiative managed by Tourism Western Australia. The Minister said the funding would enable the partnership to deliver on preparatory work undertaken over the last few years, building on from the shire's Chinatown Development Strategy and the Broome Growth Plan. \"Revitalising Chinatown is important for the town's future and we will now be able to go ahead and reinvigorate the traditional heart of Broome, delivering short, medium and long-term benefits to the local economy,\" he said.
