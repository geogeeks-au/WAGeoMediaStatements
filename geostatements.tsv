938	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/05/Campaign-to-ensure-safety-of-second-hand-cots.aspx	About 50 West Australian children are taken to hospital with cot-related injuries each year, prompting a new campaign to educate parents about the safety of second-hand cots.  Commerce Minister Michael Mischin said the campaign aimed to prevent the sale or exchange of dangerous cots that did not comply with current Australian safety standards. "The child safety campaign will be directed to parent groups, online classified sites, charity and second-hand furniture stores as well as the wider community," Mr Mischin said. "Posters, a video and a smartphone app have been produced outlining the mandatory standards for cots to prevent injuries or deaths; such as the minimum and maximum gap allowed between the bars to ensure an infant won't get its head or limbs trapped. "New parents are often given cots by friends or relatives, so it's important that these cots are examined carefully and checks are carried out to prevent any injuries or deaths.  It is illegal for retail stores to sell a product that fails to comply with mandatory safety standards." The main measurements to check are: "We don't want cots to become a death trap for infants or be the cause of an injury, so we urge all parents to make themselves familiar with the safety requirements and destroy older cots which do not meet the mandatory standards," the Minister said. "We should all be conscious of hazards that may threaten babies and infants, so cots that don't comply should be taken out of circulation, never passed on or sold."

939	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/02/Early-success-with-golden-bandicoot-release.aspx	An ambitious plan to return threatened golden bandicoots to the wild at the Matuwa Kurrara-Kurrara Indigenous Protected Area, north-east of Wiluna in the Goldfields, has shown early signs of success. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said 93 golden bandicoots were moved from inside Matuwa's introduced predator-free enclosure back to their natural range in September 2015. "Feral cats have been reduced by annual aerial baiting throughout Matuwa over several years and additional cat trapping was undertaken within the release area before and after the bandicoots were released," Mr Jacob said. "Despite some losses of golden bandicoots to dingo predation, early signs are showing the animals are becoming established." The Minister said recent trapping recaptured 30 animals and they had increased their body weight post-release by 30 to 50 per cent. "All 26 females caught during two trapping sessions were carrying pouch young.  Of these, two females showed signs of successful weaning and remarkably, nine of the 10 females in the second trapping had four pouch young each. This is a great outcome because two offspring is the usual number," he said. "Other positive signs were sightings of young golden bandicoot tracks and indications that animals were spreading up to three kilometres from the release zone. "All the evidence suggests that the majority of the released animals have survived and there are sufficient resources to support the new population."

942	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2015/12/Start-of-extended-Christmas-shopping-hours.aspx	From tomorrow, extended retail trading hours for the Christmas period will begin, giving Perth shoppers an extra 51 hours to find gifts for family and friends. Commerce Minister Michael Mischin said major retailers could open as early as 7am on weekdays and Saturdays, 8am on Sunday and close later at 6pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Mr Mischin said he had also approved an extension to trading hours to allow City of Perth traders to open from 6pm to 9pm tomorrow evening to coincide with the annual Christmas Pageant. "The extended trading for December will provide greater convenience, choice and flexibility for Perth consumers when doing their pre and post-Christmas shopping this year, and is in line with the State Government's commitment to gradually ease restrictions," he said. The Minister reminded shoppers to exercise their consumer rights, especially if the gifts they bought needed to be returned. "Consumers are entitled to a refund, replacement or repair if the product they buy is faulty, unsafe or not as described," Mr Mischin said. "There are strong laws in place to protect consumers and give them a guarantee that the products they buy from Australian-based retailers, including those trading online, are free from defects, fit for their intended purpose and match the description in any advertising. "However, if consumers want to return a gift because it's the wrong size, they don't like the style or colour or just want to exchange it for another gift they prefer, then the returns policy will differ from store to store and are completely at the retailer's discretion. "If you receive a gift card, make sure you take note of the terms and conditions and the expiry date, or redeem it as soon as possible, as it's estimated Australian retailers make $300 million from unclaimed gift vouchers each year which the consumer is better off spending."

Culture and the Arts Minister John Day said the tower would be lit in NAIDOC colours as part of a day of activities at Elizabeth Quay celebrating the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The day will include a welcome to country by Noongar elders and Aboriginal dance groups as well as a flag raising ceremony, community stalls, children's activities, and performances by local musicians. "The completion of the lighting system upgrade is timely, as we welcome a week of NAIDOC events and activities," Mr Day said. "Sunday's activities will be capped off with the Bell Tower spire being lit up in NAIDOC colours in the evening." The Minister said the tower was now able to show a sequence of colours that could be used to celebrate or commemorate key events throughout the year. "The new system can also be integrated with the Elizabeth Quay lights including those around  the bridge," he said. The LED lighting project was undertaken jointly by the Swan Bells Foundation and the Department of Culture and the Arts. The new system uses more advanced lighting technology that is simpler to use and more cost efficient with the LED lights using less energy, and the system requiring less maintenance.

Mr Redman said the redevelopment project would dramatically improve facilities at the two historic lighthouses, situated in Augusta and Dunsborough. "The Capes lighthouses are icons of the South-West that currently attract 150,000 visitors per year," he said. "Not only are they a valuable part of our State's maritime heritage, they also bookend the Cape to Cape walking track and act as the starting point for events like the Augusta Adventure Fest and Cape to Cape MTB." The $1.5 million Royalties for Regions investment will contribute to capital works on eight buildings across the two sites to increase visitor capacity, develop new interpretation services and add new attractions such as a cafe, playground and lookout. "On top of the investments in regional events, tourism marketing and infrastructure like the Busselton-Margaret River Regional Airport; Margaret River Perimeter Road; and Augusta Boat Harbour, the lighthouse project is another example of how Royalties for Regions is supporting tourism in the South-West," the Minister said. The project is one of the first to be funded through the $642 million State-wide Regional Investment Blueprint initiative. The total cost of the project is $1.75 million, with the Margaret River Busselton Tourism Association contributing the remaining $250,000.

Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the project was designed to reduce the number and severity of crashes at the intersection, improving safety for road users. "A number of improvements were undertaken as part of the upgrade to this major blackspot intersection in Kardinya, which is used by about 30,000 vehicles every weekday," Mr Nalder said. "In the period from January 2010 to December 2014, 141 crashes were recorded at the intersection. "The program of works included upgraded pedestrian facilities, traffic signal modifications, extra street lighting and a series of civil, signage and pavement marking improvements." The Minister said the additional and extended turning lanes would reduce congestion by increasing vehicle capacity, minimising wait times and boosting overall traffic efficiency at the intersection. "The upgraded lanes are expected to result in less rear-end collisions, therefore improving safety and access for motorists," he said. "Pedestrian safety has also been enhanced with the installation of zebra crossings on both South Street and North Lake Road." The project was undertaken by Main Roads' Integrated Service Provider DownerMouchel and funded by the State capital program.

946	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/PMH-celebrates-more-than-a-century-of-care.aspx	Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) is celebrating 107 years of care today, with patients, families, staff and community members gathering to mark the iconic Western Australian institution's last birthday before the opening of the new Perth Children's Hospital (PCH). Cutting the birthday cake, Health Minister John Day paid tribute to PMH's history and said its proud traditions would be reflected in the new $1.2 billion hospital, which is named in honour of the original 1909 hospital. "Before it became Princess Margaret Hospital in 1949, it was called Perth Children's Hospital," the Minister said. "For 107 years, it has been synonymous with care and hope. "The Liberal National Government stands with PMH staff, the Child and Adolescent Health Service and the community in our shared commitment to ensuring the new PCH builds on the legacy of more than a century of healthcare dedication." In 1909, the hospital opened as a 20-bed facility with one operating theatre. It is now an internationally recognised tertiary paediatric hospital, treating about 250,000 children and adolescents each year.  In the 1960s, the PMH pharmacy introduced the use of 'keep out of the reach of children' labels on medicine containers - something to be later adopted by the Pharmaceutical Society that became standard on all Australian medicine containers.  "Throughout its history, PMH has led the way in a variety of medical practices," Mr Day said. "In the 1940s, the hospital became a world leader in treating conditions such as cleft palate and today a number of surgical, paediatric medicine and mental health services are highly renowned."  Today, patients will receive treats from PMH Foundation volunteers, party themed activities will take place in the PMH Megazone and sporting guests will be on site to join in the celebrations. Staff, many in fancy dress, will enjoy cake and coffee at a party in the megazone. "I congratulate the PMH Foundation for helping with a number of events and activities planned to mark the hospital's achievements," the Minister said.

Launching the kit at Applecross Senior High School, Education Minister Peter Collier said it was essential young people were fully informed about drugs, and given the skills to make safe choices. "Crystal methamphetamine, also known as ice, is at the extreme end of the drug scale and not widely used by school-aged students, but we simply can't ignore the damage this drug can cause," Mr Collier said. The Minister was joined at the launch by Australian international cricketer Brad Hogg, a School Drug Education and Road Aware (SDERA) ambassador, along with Mental Health Minister Andrea Mitchell. The online kit includes fact sheets, a directory of support agencies and a new professional learning program, Talking Drugs. The Liberal National Government has invested $250,000 in the kit to give staff, students and parents up-to-date information about methamphetamine and other drugs. "Schools will be able to make decisions about which drugs they address directly with their students, and that should be based on the age of students and the communities they live in," Ms Mitchell said. "As always, the main focus is on ensuring the health and wellbeing of all students and preventing harm." In May, the Government announced a $14.9 million investment in strategies to reduce demand for meth, including frontline drug support nurses and the State Ice Helpline.

"About 260 million litres of water is being saved each year in Rossmoyne, Shelley, Waterford and parts of Beckenham, where pressure management works are already complete." The new round of suburbs has been assessed and prioritised by the Water Corporation based on existing water pressure, the historical frequency of leaks and breaks in the pipe network and overall water use volumes.  These suburbs receive average pressures in the range of 42 to 66 metres head.  This will be gradually reduced to 35 metres head, which is more than double the required minimum standard.  "Pressure reductions will be implemented gradually in stages starting later this year. This will result in more consistent pressure and greatly minimise leaks and breaks caused from excessively high water pressure," the Minister said. "The corporation has a community liaison team which will work closely with residents and businesses to keep them informed before any pressure reductions take place. "Advice from the irrigation industry has confirmed correctly installed and maintained irrigation systems operate effectively at the pressures that customers will receive." The 10-year pressure management program forms part of the State Government's water loss management strategy and is expected to save more than 10 billion litres of water each year once fully implemented.  For more information about the pressure management program, visit    Minister's office - 6552 5500	{"minister": "Davies", "portfolio": "Water"}	2016-06-16

Heritage Minister Albert Jacob said Pithara Hall and Supper Room was highly valued by the small agricultural town in the Shire of Dalwallinu. "This building is a landmark in the town centre of Pithara and is much loved for the memories it evokes of civic and social events that have taken place in the hall," Mr Jacob said. "Social participation is essential in rural towns and the local hall is the focal point for social activities.  It provides a place for the community to feel connected and united. "Pithara Hall and Supper Room is a good representative example of regional halls built during the depression, at a time when many rural towns were struggling financially." Since construction in 1931, the rendered brick, multi-room hall has held public meetings and a multitude of leisure activities including dances, sporting club activities and movies nights, which have enriched the community's experience of rural life.  The hall even served as a military hospital during World War ll when an armoured division and three army camps were based around Pithara because of the threat of Japanese invasion.  The main room became an operating theatre with tents outside acting as wards. The adjoining supper room was built in 1956, replacing the original 1918 timber town hall.  Pithara Hall and Supper Room remain relatively unchanged since their construction.  The hall was closed around 1999 because of water and termite damage, and requires upgrading to meet regulations.  However, the supper room is still being used by local groups. "Pithara continues to serve as a base for the local farming community and the many visitors in spring when wildflowers bloom in the region," the Minister said. "Pithara Hall and Supper Room encapsulates the history of this small community, which was once a thriving town on a main railway line that assisted in the expansion of agriculture."

Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the improved access was part of the Liberal National Government's investment in high-quality tourism infrastructure in national parks. "We are encouraging more people to experience the natural wonders in our diverse and beautiful national parks, with better facilities and easier access," Mr Jacob said. "These new stairs and walkways provide a safer and user-friendly path to the bottom of the 100 metre deep Dales Gorge.  "This project has delivered a safer walk with stunning views for visitors, with platforms along the walk allowing tourists to stop and take in the beauty of the gorge walls and the falls. "With the July school holidays approaching, I hope more people will take the opportunity to experience the beauty of this part of Karijini National Park." The Minister said the walk trail was made of raw steel for durability and to blend in with the iron-rich gorge walls.  The stairs and walkways were designed and prefabricated by staff from the Department of Parks and Wildlife Perth Hills district and then assembled onsite. The terrain presented its own challenges, with Perth crews and local Pilbara staff carrying in materials and using welders, grinders and other hot works at the gorge.  Dales Gorge camping area has bush toilets, picnic tables and gas barbecues.  It is a large campground with several camping loops, a camp host facility, toilets and gas barbecues. The State Government is also investing $21.05 million in the Parks for People Caravan and Camping initiative to create more camping and caravan sites in national parks and reserves.  Since 2013, the Government has created 337 new camping sites, with at least 450 to be built.

Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the Liberal National Government's smart transport project would revolutionise bus travel in the CBD.  "The new busport has been designed to accommodate 50 per cent more bus movements than the old Wellington Street Bus Station," Mr Nalder said.  "This means we can move more people, more efficiently around our modern, growing city. "This project has involved demolishing the old, above-ground Wellington Street Bus Station in 2014 and replacing it with a world-class underground facility. "Sinking the complex railway track system and the bus station has significantly transformed the centre of our capital city.   "The State Government has delivered a long-term plan and vision to reconnect Northbridge and the CBD and set the stage for a blend of open space, plazas and walkways, and existing, new and future developments." Passengers will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the new facility at a public open day on Saturday, July 16, before it opens for operations the next day.  The Perth Busport is fully air-conditioned, features 160 seats, 16 bus stands, two bus entrance-exits, toilets and baby change facilities, and two kiosks.

954	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Aberdeen-Street-complex-no-1-by-name-nature.aspx	A Liberal National Government apartment development has been named Australia's best affordable housing development at this year's National Property Council of Australia Innovation and Excellence Awards. Housing Minister Colin Holt said the award recognised the $73 million One on Aberdeen development in Northbridge as a great demonstration of how government could work with the private sector to achieve outstanding affordability outcomes. "The Housing Authority worked with developer Diploma Properties to deliver a high quality, 13-storey development with 161 residential and seven commercial units on what was previously idle Government land," Mr Holt said. "The project has delivered high levels of affordability through innovative design and a diversity of apartment types, including initiatives to target low and moderate income renters and purchasers." The One on Aberdeen project arose out of the State Government's Affordable Housing Strategy which challenged the Housing Authority to efficiently optimise Government assets to support private sector investment, housing supply and social policy outcomes. Forty per cent of the apartments were specifically made available to people on low-to-moderate incomes who would otherwise face barriers to owning or renting their own home. This included purchasers through Keystart home loans and shared equity home ownership with the Housing Authority, along with affordable and social rentals for people on low incomes.  "Careful consideration in the planning and delivery stages ensured that while affordability was maintained, there was no compromise on quality in construction and finishes," the Minister said. One on Aberdeen is located on a site with close proximity to the Perth CBD and public transport. "The development reinvigorated a tired precinct in the Perth CBD, bringing economic activity and a ripple effect on surrounding land values," Mr Holt said. "Rather than being a passive seller of the land, the Government in this instance chose to be an active equity partner and to reinvest its return in retained units, which was a significant shift in the way Government partners with the private sector."

New facilities include an ocean-facing gym, meeting and training rooms, change rooms, a first aid room, equipment wash-down areas and a member's lounge. Mr Barnett said the significant upgrade would not only improve the operation of the facility, but also represented an investment in the long-term health of the local community. "Members of the City of Perth Surf Life Saving Club play a crucial role in protecting City Beach visitors and it is essential they are supported with adequate facilities," he said.  "The design was developed with extensive community consultation, which identified the need for improved and expanded facilities, with the club's outdated building at capacity. The new club will provide a fantastic hub for local residents and visitors, providing healthy lifestyle activities that can be enjoyed by the community." The facility is part of the revitalised City Beach precinct, with the Town of Cambridge developing the area around the building to include parkland, restaurants, an amphitheatre and a promenade.  A key design feature is the striking green concrete roof that provides a landscaped public plaza above the building. The total cost of the redevelopment was $8.5 million. Through the Community Sporting and Recreation Facilities Fund, the Liberal National Government invested $950,000 in the club with a further $950,000 from Lotterywest. The City of Perth Surf Life Saving Club invested $1.75 million and the Town of Cambridge provided $4.85 million. Sport and Recreation Minister Mia Davies said City Beach had grown to become one of Australia's largest surf life saving clubs, with more than 1,280 members and 6,343 patrol hours each year. "Through DSR, the State Government has contributed more than $3.6 million to seven surf life saving projects since 2008.  We are also supporting surf lifesaving through our award-winning KidSport  , which has provided more than $94,000 to surf clubs State-wide since 2011," Ms Davies said.

"He has been the driving force behind plans to redevelop ANZAC House into a purpose-built headquarters that will secure the league's future for years to come," he said. With its motto 'The Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance' as relevant as ever, the RSL this year is marking the centenary of its establishment. Formed by a group of returned servicemen from the Great War, the organisation was originally called the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, before becoming the RSL in 1965.  However, the league's charter has not changed; to support serving and ex-service defence force members and their families.

958	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/New-campaign-aims-to-reduce-non-urgent-ED-visits.aspx	A new advertising campaign launched today by the Liberal National Government will urge West Australians to consider alternative health care options to Emergency Departments (EDs).  The campaign aims to reduce the number of people attending hospital EDs with minor illnesses or injuries, by highlighting a number of other health services available for non-emergency issues. Health Minister John Day said the State Government campaign would complement current information available on the HealthyWA website, including a symptom checker tool where a person could enter their symptoms and get trusted advice on what to do next. "In 2015, Western Australian hospitals recorded 1,009,707 ED attendances, an increase of 49 per cent - or about 330,000 attendances - since 2005," Mr Day said.  "We know about 130,000 of these visits could have been addressed by other health care options such as GPs and   or appropriate self-assessment. "EDs are not always the best place to be treated or recuperate from an illness and we need to ensure they remain free for emergencies." The Minister said hospitals and EDs nationally and internationally continued to face challenges in regard to increasing demand for their services. "As our population grows and ages, we expect to see more patients coming to EDs with urgent and complex care needs," he said. "While we do not want to stop people who have an urgent or life-threatening condition going to an ED, we do want to reduce the number of people visiting with non-urgent issues. "This will ensure we can continue to treat those people in emergency in a timely manner with the appropriate level of care." The health care options campaign will include TV, print, digital and social media and will run for an initial period during the winter months.

959	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/New-scheme-to-help-create-Waterwise-verges.aspx	Creating attractive, sustainable Waterwise verges is becoming easier with the Water Corporation launching a new incentive scheme and best practice guidelines. Water Minister Mia Davies said the Liberal National Government supported the Waterwise Verge Incentive scheme and Waterwise Verge Best Practice Guidelines, which would help Waterwise councils to promote low water use verge gardens in communities.  "Through the scheme, Waterwise councils will be eligible to receive up to $10,000 a year to support their own Waterwise verge incentive schemes," Ms Davies said. "A well designed Waterwise verge contributes to the visual aesthetic of streets, increases the thermal performance of houses and provides ecological benefits, such as providing habitat for local wildlife and promoting biodiversity. "The new guidelines and incentive scheme will balance this with the wise use of water.  This is an important step in ensuring our communities continue to adapt to the drying climate." The Waterwise Verge Best Practice Guidelines were developed in consultation with local government and the landscape industry, incorporating learnings from previous verge policies and best practice landscape design principles. "These guidelines are available from the corporation's website and can be used by local governments across the State," the Minister said.  "They provide a benchmark for local governments to create sustainable, Waterwise verge policies for ratepayers." The incentive scheme is available to endorsed Waterwise councils with a verge policy consistent with the Waterwise Verge Best Practice Guidelines.

960	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Tough-new-laws-to-pull-the-brakes-on-hoons.aspx	The Liberal National Government has again achieved another major election commitment, delivering tough new laws making it easier to permanently confiscate vehicles of hoon drivers. Deputy Premier and Police Minister Liza Harvey said the new legislation, being introduced to State Parliament this week, responded to community frustration and fears of dangerous hoon drivers in their streets. Mrs Harvey said under the new laws, courts could order permanent vehicle confiscation on a first offence if a motorist did any of the following: "These new laws build on our successful existing hoon legislation and initiatives such as covert hoon cameras, which will help enforce the new laws," she said. "The new laws mean if you put our schoolchildren and residents in danger with your childish and reckless driving, you could lose your car for good." The Minister said the new laws would remove the red tape which tied up the permanent confiscation process and the resale or scrapping of uncollected hoon vehicles, saving taxpayers money. "After the 28-day impoundment, the owner has three weeks to collect the vehicle or it's gone and the surplus money will be deposited into the Road Trauma Trust Account," she said. "Forty-nine days is plenty of time for an owner to organise collection of their vehicle." Mrs Harvey said the new laws would also give police the power to seize unlicensed motorcycles such as trail bikes if they reasonably suspected they had been illegally ridden on the road. "This will help address increasing complaints about the danger, noise and disruption caused by unlicensed, and mostly unroadworthy, trail bikes being illegally ridden on our roads," she said.

Transport Minister Dean Nalder said Wangara-based Ertech Pty Ltd won the $8.339 million contract following an extensive expressions of interest and tender process, and would deliver the 88 metre extension to the wharf, hardstand extension, four new trawler pens and raising of the southern breakwater.   "About 7,600 cubic metres of locally sourced rock will be used to increase the height of the breakwater to protect the trawler pens, while about 140 tonnes of steel will be used to extend the wharf to provide a new heavy lift zone and hardstand, significantly increasing the capacity of the facility," Mr Nalder said.  "Work will commence on the marine structures and civil works in mid-July, ensuring the upgrade project remains on schedule for completion by mid-2017." Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said he was looking forward to the Exmouth Boat Harbour upgrade moving to the next and most important stage of implementation. "As the largest harbour south of the Pilbara, Exmouth is strategically well placed and this upgrade reinforces the facility as an important maritime hub in the State's north," Mr Redman said. "The Exmouth Boat Harbour will better accommodate and service the rapidly growing supply vessel traffic, supporting the resources industry, as well as the growing tourist and recreational vessel traffic for the benefit of both current and future generations.  "Investments through Royalties for Regions, like the Exmouth Boat Harbour upgrade, are enabling regional Western Australian communities to strengthen their capabilities and realise their economic potential."

962	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Water-improvements-to-begin-in-Wundowie.aspx	The Water Corporation will start work next week on an $11.3 million project to provide a more secure water supply to people living in Wundowie.  Water Minister Mia Davies said the Liberal National Government project included the construction of a new 2.5 million litre capacity water storage tank, which could hold the equivalent of an Olympic-sized swimming pool of water. "The new tank will provide significantly increased water storage in Wundowie and cater for future population growth in the town," Ms Davies said. The corporation will also build two new pump stations and 6.2km of water main to supply water to the town from the new tank.  "By building the tank at a high elevation point, the town's water pressure will be improved with the help of gravity," the Minister said.  A further 3.8km of water main will also be installed on Golf Links Road from the new tank to supply water to the growing Mauravillo subdivision, north of Wundowie.  Ms Davies said there would be some traffic disruptions and temporary water supply interruptions when the infrastructure was connected to the town's existing water pipelines. "The corporation will work closely with the community to provide advanced notice of these necessary interruptions and local residents will receive regular updates throughout the course of this project," she said.  The project is expected to be completed by the end of May 2017. Minister's office - 6552 5500	{"minister": "Davies", "portfolio": "Water"}	2016-06-21
963	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Funds-to-help-charities-dispose-of-unwanted-goods.aspx	Charitable recyclers can now apply for a rebate to help recover some of the cost of disposing unusable donations that have been dumped at charitable clothing bins. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the Charitable Recyclers Rebate program would provide an estimated $300,000 annually to eligible charitable recyclers to meet the cost of the landfill levy. Mr Jacob said the program recognised the substantial costs charities incurred to dispose of household goods that could not be reused or recycled. "Charitable recyclers provide an essential community service to West Australians in need, however they are often left with an unsightly and expensive problem," he said.  "Many unusable and unrecyclable items are dropped off at clothing recycling bins with good intentions, however a lot of waste dumped illegally at these locations needs to be removed. "This waste has the potential to cause health hazards and environmental harm, and also attracts antisocial or low-level crime activities.  It also costs the charity $60 a tonne to take to a landfill site, and this is money they could spend on helping needy people."  The rebate program is the first of two Liberal National Government initiatives to tackle illegal dumping at charitable recyclers. The Charitable Recyclers Dumping Reduction Program will be launched later this year.  This program will help fund charitable recyclers to implement measures such as improved lighting, fencing and educational material, to reduce illegal dumping of unusable items at bins and premises.  Guidelines and application forms for the landfill levy rebate are available at  . Applications will be assessed quarterly, with the first round closing at 5pm on July 28, 2016.

Environment Minister Albert Jacob said all West Australians who undertook projects to reduce waste and increase re-use and recycling could nominate. "The Infinity Awards acknowledge the success of individuals and organisations which help to achieve the aims of the Liberal National Government's strategy to reduce waste," Mr Jacob said "It's important to acknowledge work that advances better waste management.  Innovation, commitment and creativity have been the hallmarks of past award recipients and I'm eager to see the efforts of this year's entrants."  The Infinity Awards are open to individuals, businesses, local councils, community organisations, State Government agencies, schools and universities which demonstrate a commitment to improving the way the community deals with waste.  Under the Liberal National Government's Waste Strategy: Creating the Right Environment, the recovery target for municipal solid waste in Perth is 65 per cent by 2020 and in major regional centres, 50 per cent by 2020. State-wide recovery targets for the commercial and industrial sector are 70 per cent by 2020 and for construction and demolition waste the State-wide target is 75 per cent by 2020.  The Infinity Award winners will be announced on September 15, 2016 at the annual Waste and Recycle Conference.

965	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Western-Power-complies-with-wood-pole-order.aspx	An EnergySafety review has confirmed that Western Power has met the requirements of an order issued in September 2009 to make its rural wood distribution poles safe and to develop a sound management plan for their maintenance. The order required Western Power to reinforce or replace all aged hardwood poles in its rural distribution network. Commerce Minister Michael Mischin said completion of the work under the order was a major public safety achievement, with Western Power treating about 170,000 poles in rural areas. "I am confident that compliance with the order will significantly reduce the risk of bushfires and power interruptions caused by wood poles breaking at ground level and falling," Mr Mischin said. "Jarrah and other hardwood poles used throughout the electricity network can be weakened at the ground line by fungal and termite attack, which can lead to failure when subject to wind forces much less than applicable standards require them to withstand. "The Director of EnergySafety has carried out his own checks and assessments to confirm that pole reinforcement and replacement work has been completed in the rural network in accordance with the order." Energy Minister Mike Nahan said the work was completed safely, on time and under budget, with a $620 million investment from the Liberal National Government. "In addition to significantly reducing the public safety risk posed by wood poles, the order helped prompt a profound change in the way Western Power manages its power pole network including inspection practices, data management and work practices," Dr Nahan said.  "Western Power is also proceeding with reinforcing and replacing wood poles in the metropolitan area and in regional centres.  Already, more than half the poles needing attention have been reinforced or replaced under a risk-based priority system.  "This work will continue, with the poles presenting the greatest risk of failure being attended to in order of priority.  Any poles found to present an imminent risk will be treated immediately."

John Wilson has been volunteering for the Western Australian Water Ski Association for more than a quarter of a century and is still actively involved in the sport.  Speaking at the Liberal National Government's WA Volunteer Service Awards, Seniors and Volunteering Minister Tony Simpson said Mr Wilson was a fantastic example of a Western Australian volunteer who devoted years of his life to his passion.  "More than two decades ago, Mr Wilson was approached by a girl in a wheelchair who wanted to water ski.  Since that time, he has helped numerous children with disability to pursue this sport," Mr Simpson said.  "By providing their time and resources, volunteers help deliver services, products and opportunities that otherwise might have been more expensive or not provided at all. "I commend Mr Wilson and all the other volunteers for their service over the past 25 or more years - they truly are the backbone of our communities."  The WA Volunteer Service Awards program recognises Western Australian volunteers who have provided 25 or more and 50 or more years of service to one organisation.  Volunteers who have dedicated 50 or more years will be recognised at a ceremony to be held on Thank a Volunteer Day on December 5.

The framework is a three-year guide to improving outcomes for Aboriginal children, families and communities who come into contact with the child protection system.  Ms Mitchell said the increasing number of Aboriginal children entering out-of-home care necessitated a strong, focused and culturally responsive approach to improving the delivery of services, and ultimately outcomes for Aboriginal children and families. "We have worked with a range of stakeholders, including the Aboriginal community to identify the foundation elements, guiding principles and priority areas for change that will assist in achieving this vision," she said. The framework identifies four priority areas, including capacity building, community engagement, practice development and people development. "These areas build on and inform current Department for Child Protection and Family Support reforms in out-of-home care and the Earlier Intervention and Family Support strategy," the Minister said. "Today's launch further demonstrates the department's commitment to improving outcomes for Aboriginal children, families and communities. "With an Aboriginal staffing profile of nearly nine per cent, the department has one of the highest levels of Aboriginal employees in the Western Australian public sector." Staffing includes a dedicated Aboriginal Engagement and Coordination directorate, and one or more Aboriginal practice leaders in every district across the State providing high-level cultural advice and practice guidance on individual cases.

Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the RADS grants provided much needed funds for regional airport projects to help improve regional air services and air safety, as well as promote development for the benefit of regional communities. "Funding from RADS grants helps numerous regional airports, some located in the most remote areas in WA, maintain and upgrade their airport infrastructure as well as undertake planning to ensure regional airports continue to meet the economic and community needs in our regions," Mr Nalder said. "Since 2008-09, RADS has allocated nearly $36 million to 217 regional airport projects, helping to improve their facilities and airport infrastructure planning." The 2017-19 round of funding is available to eligible owners or leaseholders of regional airports that can be accessed by the public.  Applications for grants must provide for common-user transport infrastructure to improve air services and/or air safety for regional communities. "The Liberal National Government is committed to ensuring safe and accessible aviation services that meet the transport needs of regional communities across WA.  These grants help make this possible," the Minister said.  The 2017-19 RADS grants are funded through the Department of Transport. All applications for grants will be assessed by the RADS consultative committee which is made up of representatives from the departments of Transport, Fire and Emergency Services, Planning, Housing, and Regional Development; along with the Royal Flying Doctor Service; and Tourism WA.

The Sale of Land Amendment Bill 2016 will address potential issues buyers may face when purchasing a lot off the plan. Lands Minister Terry Redman said currently, developers were able to offer land for sale without first obtaining relevant approvals and titles. "This can be very risky for the purchaser if finance for the development falls through or the developer is unscrupulous and absconds with the purchaser's deposit," he said. Mr Redman said a 2014 Supreme Court decision had led to legal uncertainty about the ability of developers to enforce sales contracts if they were signed before they owned the land. "This legal uncertainty has been detrimental to the property industry because developers have been constrained in their ability to deliver new projects and banks have been reluctant to lend money in these circumstances," he said. The Minister said the Liberal National Government's proposed legislation would enable developers to sell lots off the plan while also providing extra protection for buyers. "The amendments to the Act will clearly state the obligations of developers and buyers when the developer is not the registered owner of the land at the time of sale," Mr Redman said. "Sales contracts will make buyers aware of the situation and will provide a deadline for the developer to become the registered owner of the lot. "Deposits will be held in Australian trust accounts and will be refunded if the developer fails to meet the deadline. "These amendments will clear up uncertainties relating to the enforceability of sales contracts which will support the release of affordable new lots and subdivisions into the market."

The Laverton community hub project will receive $8.01 million for a replacement swimming pool, a new indoor multi-purpose building as well as refurbishments to the town hall to deliver a new youth centre, office space and a community amphitheatre. The Norseman airfield project will receive $1.45 million to upgrade infrastructure at the airfield, in particular the runway, taxiway and apron pavements to provide aircraft with 24-hour access. Mr Redman said the projects were great examples of Royalties for Regions investing in community-based projects that would deliver social and economic benefits and contributed to the attraction and retention of residents in the region. "The Laverton community hub project will deliver a new central meeting place for the residents of Laverton and visitors from Ngaanyatjarra Lands where social, recreational, sporting, artistic and educational activities can flourish," he said. "The upgrade of the Norseman airfield will allow small and medium-size aircraft to use the airfield more often, and improve the safety of aircraft operations in circumstances where the airfield may not otherwise be available for use. "Royalties for Regions is contributing to the development of strong and sustainable communities to support long-term growth in our regions."

Formerly known as Fishers with Disabilities, Fishability is a volunteer group which provides jetty and vessel-based fishing activities to children and adults living with disability. Attending the launch of the new Geraldton program at the Batavia Museum boardwalk today, Mr Barnett said the initiative could not have happened without members of the community who had volunteered or supported the association's establishment in the Mid-West. "The recent effort to expand the Fishability program in regional areas is another great achievement among many that have seen the organisation continue to grow over 16 years," Mr Barnett said. "I congratulate all of the association's volunteers and supporters throughout the State, who dedicate themselves to providing regular recreational fishing opportunities to improve the health and wellbeing of participants."   Fisheries Minister Joe Francis said Fishability received an annual grant of $75,000 from the Department of Fisheries as well as financial support from the Recreational Fishing Initiatives Fund (RFIF). "RFIF receives 25 per cent of all recreational fishing licence fees which it allocates to worthy projects and initiatives such as Fishability," Mr Francis said. "That funding has allowed the organisation to conduct activities such as its annual Fishability Day and to develop a map which shows locations that are accessible to people with disabilities.

975	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Forecast-looks-good-for-Gascoyne-Junction.aspx	Disruptions in the Gascoyne region due to floods will be significantly reduced, with the Liberal National Government today announcing $9.045 million of Royalties for Regions investment to construct a new low-level bridge system over the Gascoyne River at Gascoyne Junction. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said this Royalties for Regions investment would provide surety of access to essential services and amenities at Gascoyne Junction. "The crossing at Gascoyne Junction is vital for the inland transport corridor linking the Pilbara and Gascoyne and providing access to Carnarvon and the rest of the State," Mr Redman said. "In times of flooding, the existing structure is unreliable and essentially splits the town in two, leaving some residents with no access to facilities including school and health services." The Gascoyne River Crossing - Gascoyne Junction project will provide a safe and reliable crossing in all but extreme flood events, improving vehicle access for the mining industry, pastoralists, residents and tourists in the region.  The Gascoyne River is prone to flooding and the current crossing, originally built in the 1950s, contributes to an average annual road closure time of 33 days, causing severe economic and social impact. "The necessary detours of up to 700 kilometres is a significant detractor for potential commercial and tourist road users who would seek to avoid an increased travel time of up to 11 hours," the Minister said.  The project, managed by the Shire of Upper Gascoyne, is ready for construction, with critical work expected to be completed prior to the cyclone season and finalised by mid-2017.

Mental Health Minister Andrea Mitchell said the centre, which would provide recovery oriented services in a residential style setting, was on track to open in September 2016. "The Liberal National Government is funding Mind Australia $5.7 million over five years to deliver services to assist people to recover from mental illness in a community setting," Ms Mitchell said. "Mind Australia will partner with the South Metropolitan Health Service to provide on-site clinical support services. "This is an innovative model that is a further example of the public-private partnerships that provides West Australians with the best value and outcomes for their healthcare dollar." With construction expected to be completed by July 2016, the Minister said the new facility would deliver step-up services that provided short-term residential support to help people manage a change in their mental health, and step-down services to assist people transitioning back to living in the community after discharge from acute hospital care. "The provision of adequate community beds and the strengthening of appropriate services in the community are crucial to reducing inappropriate and therefore excess demand for acute hospital care," Ms Mitchell said. Step-up, step-down services help build better community understanding of mental health issues, removing much of the trauma, stigma and cost that can result from episodes of mental illness.

"One of the operator's first priorities will be to undertake a recruitment search for key operational personnel ahead of employing about 70 full-time operational staff and an additional workforce of 1,750 for event days," she said, adding that the recruitment process for the chief executive officer would commence today.  "VenuesLive will also now progress key contracts for ticketing and security, while working with Tourism Western Australia and VenuesWest to secure a range of exciting events for Perth Stadium." Ms Davies said as part of its bid, VenuesLive proposed on average 40 different events each year using its unique experience driving events at ANZ Stadium within the Sydney Olympic Park Precinct.  "The State Government is focused on ensuring this world-class Perth Stadium and its surrounding sports precinct delivers a year-round event schedule comprising a mix of large and small events across the precinct facilities," she said. The Minister said the operator would now enter into negotiations to finalise user agreements with football and cricket while talks would also be progressed with other potential users such as Australian Rugby Union and Football Federation Australia, English Premier League clubs, concert promoters plus a range of community arts and smaller sport event owners.   VenuesLive is contracted for an initial five-year term and the State Government has an option to extend for a further five years.  Construction of the stadium is more than 40 per cent complete and on schedule to open in time for the start of the 2018 AFL season.

Transport Minister Dean Nalder said he would issue a direction to Pilbara Ports Authority to extend the discount regime to June 30, 2017. The Government originally announced a $2.50 per tonne discount for the junior operators in May 2015, which was due to expire on Thursday (June 30, 2016).  Mr Nalder said the decision would help junior operators such as Atlas Iron and Mineral Resources Limited preserve employment for their workers, contractors and suppliers. "The Government has had great success with the Utah Point facility," he said.  "The initiative to build the port has unlocked iron ore deposits that would have been difficult to access, enabling additional economic development in the Pilbara including thousands of jobs." State Development Minister Bill Marmion said the Liberal National Government had also decided to extend the discount to manganese exports handled at the facility to encourage the remobilisation of the nearby Woodie Woodie mine. "We would like to see Woodie Woodie recommence operations and the extension of the discount demonstrates the Government's support for remobilisation," Mr Marmion said. The $2.50 per tonne port charge discount is conditional on the iron ore price staying below A$80 per tonne.   Transport Minister's office - 6552 6400 State Development Minister's office - 6552 6800	{"minister": "Nalder; Marmion", "portfolio": "Transport; State Development"}	2016-06-28

Seniors and Volunteering Minister Tony Simpson today met with 100 representatives from State and local governments, universities and community service organisations at a workshop to collaborate on ways to better support seniors.  Facilitated by Dr Jane Barratt, Secretary General of the International Federation on Ageing, the Age-Friendly Western Australia Workshop is one of several initiatives undertaken by the Liberal National Government to prioritise the needs of ageing West Australians.  "In 2015-16, the State Government has invested more than $1 million through the Age Friendly Communities grants into programs and initiatives to promote seniors' inclusion, participation and security," Mr Simpson said.  "Addressing the needs of our ageing population is a high priority and it's a responsibility shared across the whole of government and the wider community. "To date, half of Western Australia's local governments have received State Government funding to establish age-friendly communities. "This means 75 per cent of our seniors are now living in a local government area that has investigated what policies, services and structures seniors need, to age well."

Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the new $600,000 campground was part of the Liberal National Government's four-year, $21.05 million investment in Parks for People under the Caravan and Camping Action Plan 2013-2018. "Dryandra Woodland is one of the few places in this State where visitors can see endangered species such as numbats, woylies and tammar wallabies in the wild, as well as more than 100 bird species and 50 reptile species," Mr Jacob said.  "Now, people will be able to truly immerse themselves in this nature's paradise by camping at one of the 35 campsites, which come with a camp kitchen, new toilets, and a fireplace and table for each site. "A new walk trail originating from the campground adds to the network of walking, cycling and driving trails in the woodland.  It's also close to the popular Barna Mia sanctuary where visitors can see threatened animals up-close at night. "This campground is the latest to be rolled out as part of our commitment to provide 450 additional campsites on Parks and Wildlife-managed land over four years by 2016-17, and we are well on track to meet that target, with more than 340 sites completed so far." Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said there were increasing opportunities for West Australians and visitors to experience affordable caravan and camping holidays throughout the State. "New and improved camping facilities create positive visitor experiences and contribute to the economic sustainability and vibrancy of our regional communities," Mr Redman said.

The Department of Transport engaged the ARRB Group to conduct a safety assessment on the billboard, which measures 12.66 metres wide and 3.35 metres high, after it was activated in April 2015 raising public safety concerns. In its report, ARRB found that the digital device 'is acceptable from a safety perspective' when assessed by the Main Roads Policy and Application Guidelines for Advertising Signs, an Austroads report AP-R420-13 and relevant research. Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the Liberal National Government supported the use of billboards as an advertising tool, had accepted ARRB's findings on the Bull Creek advertising mechanism and would reactivate it on July 8. "The billboard was assessed against safety relevant criteria that have been previously and successfully applied in a number of other jurisdictions in Australia," Mr Nalder said. "The device will soon be reactivated, and to allay any public concerns we will adopt a conservative 'start-up' commissioning approach which is well within the Main Roads WA guidelines for advertising signs." The Minister said use of the electronic billboard would meet strict safety and compliance guidelines regarding colour; changeover time; size and illumination, consistent with the ARRB Group's safety assessment advice. "To assist road users to adapt to change, dwell times or the time allocated to particular advertisements will be extended to 60 seconds (from 45 seconds) and a lighting specialist will be in attendance to validate luminance levels," he said. Mr Nalder said Main Roads Western Australia would further review the safety aspects of the billboard over forthcoming months.

Disability Services Minister Donna Faragher said trials in the Lower South West, Cockburn-Kwinana and Perth Hills were being continued, allowing additional eligible people in those areas to join up.  "The extension of the NDIS trials in these areas will enable those West Australians already benefiting from the NDIS to continue to do so," Mrs Faragher said.  "It also means that additional eligible people with disability in those locations will have the opportunity to join the trial and access supports and services during the coming year." The Minister said by early 2017, the State and Commonwealth models of the NDIS would be expanded into an additional nine local governments areas ahead of an expected State-wide roll out. "By July 1 next year, 11,000 people with disability will be entitled to access the NDIS - that's nearly a quarter of all eligible West Australians," she said. "The State and Commonwealth governments are continuing to work closely to finalise how the NDIS will be governed in WA, but what we do know is that it will be nationally consistent in relation to eligibility, portability and reasonable and necessary supports." Mrs Faragher said a community engagement plan was underway to seek the views of people with disability, their families and carers on how the NDIS could best meet the needs of West Australians. "This process, which is being co-ordinated by the Ministerial Advisory Council on Disability, will give people with disability and their families and carers, the opportunity to provide valuable input about what's working best on the ground and what else could be improved," she said. The WA Government will invest $181 million this financial year to support the NDIS in WA. The Commonwealth Government will contribute $159 million for the NDIS trials in 2016-17.

Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the recent State Parliamentary debate about the Bill was the first time in more than 60 years that a Western Australian Government had considered modern conservation laws, and Labor had flunked the test of its commitment to conservation. Mr Jacob said the Liberal National Government had delivered its 2013 election commitment to introduce legislation replacing the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 - an initiative no Labor government had ever come close to doing despite repeated promises to do so. "The Labor Party is irresponsible and short-sighted for opposing the Biodiversity Conservation Bill in the Legislative Assembly last night," the Minister said. "When the moment arrived for the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia to do something that it has always aspired to do, to support a biodiversity conservation Bill, it voted against it.  "The existing law under the Wildlife Conservation Act has no capacity to deliver modern environmental management.  The Labor Party's lack of support for this new Bill shows how little it understands the complexities of biodiversity conservation. "It's clear the Opposition is more concerned with playing politics than conservation and species protection. "I have considered all past proposals and comments so the Bill has the right key features sought by most of the community.  It's a significant overhaul of WA's environmental legislation and delivers initiatives to an extent never before seen in this State."    Mr Jacob said the new Bill allowed the listing of threatened ecological communities for the first time in Western Australia.  It had the capacity to list critical habitats and included opportunities to facilitate private conservation efforts.

The legislation replaces the outdated Hospitals and Health Services Act 1927 and involves establishing boards that are legally responsible and accountable for delivering health services to their communities.  Health Minister John Day said the new Act supported the Liberal National Government's unprecedented investment in world-class infrastructure and its focus on providing care as close to home as possible. "Western Australia's population has grown to more than 2.6 million people - six times the size of the population when the previous Act was passed," Mr Day said. "Community needs and technology have changed substantially in this time and the new Act allows for a dedicated focus on local health needs across the State, whether in the country, or rapidly growing communities such as the eastern metropolitan corridor." The Minister said a key feature of the 2016 Act was the clear roles, responsibilities and accountabilities it set for all levels of the system. "The Department of Health, led by the director general, will act as the system manager and is responsible for the overall management, performance and strategic direction of WA Health, while five new Health Service Boards will oversee health services across the State," he said. "Each health service will be led by an experienced chief executive to manage day-to-day operations and deliver safe, high-quality and efficient health services to local communities." The five boards cover the North, South and East metropolitan health services, the WA Country Health Service and the Child and Adolescent Health Service.

"These amendments address the potential for victims of family violence being pressured or coerced into entering into surety arrangements on behalf of their current or former abusive partners," he said. "Additionally, the courts must take into account the views of victims when considering whether to release a person accused of a serious offence from custody and whether granting bail could endanger the safety of victims, other individuals or the community.  "We know that with family violence, in particular, the victim may be in the best position to predict the likely behaviour of the accused person if they are released on bail." The amendments also implement recommendations from the review of the Bail Act, conducted after the WA Coroner handed down his findings into the death of Aboriginal elder Mr Ward in January 2008. The Attorney General said there was a clear intent to reduce the risk that came with accused people being unnecessarily remanded in custody, particularly those living in regional and remote WA.  "This Bill seeks to provide flexibility in regard to bail for less serious offences, so that accused people are not held unnecessarily in custody on remand when it was the court or Justice of the Peace's intention that they should be released on bail," he said. "This aims to reduce unnecessary transportation of children and young people from regional areas to Perth for remand in custody. "These changes are reflective of the Liberal National Government's commitment to prevent and reduce the number of Aboriginal deaths in custody, and the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in the justice system."

994	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Bill-ensures-secure-voting-for-electors-with-disability.aspx	Electoral Affairs Minister Peter Collier has welcomed the passing of the Electoral Amendment Bill 2016, which will assist electors with disability and newly enrolled voters. The Bill will enable sight-impaired and other electors with disability to vote unassisted, online in privacy and securely. The Western Australian Electoral Commission has been given the flexibility to adapt technology that will enable these electors to have their votes securely recorded.  The new system will be independently audited. Mr Collier said that State and Federal enrolment procedures would be harmonised, so that the 170,000 new electors who had been directly enrolled for Saturday's Federal election would also be automatically placed on the State electoral roll. "Previously these voters had to fill in another form, whereas newly enrolled voters or those changing address will now be automatically enrolled for both State and Federal elections," he said. "At the 2013 State election, 150,000 WA electors voted early, and this trend is likely to increase.  Electors at pre-poll centres will no longer be asked to give a reason for requesting an early vote." The Minister said in 2017, electors would be able to vote using pens rather than pencils, bringing the State in line with Federal elections. "Paperwork at post-election count centres will also be reduced as Party secretaries will also be able to appoint scrutineers," he said. "These changes, which have been supported by both sides of politics, will enable more West Australians to exercise their vote in security and convenience and will give the WA Electoral Commission greater flexibility in the efficient conduct of future elections."

995	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/07/New-catastrophic-injuries-support-starts-today.aspx	Western Australia's expanded motor vehicle injury insurance scheme has started, meaning all motorists catastrophically injured in crashes from today (July 1, 2016) are now covered for lifetime care and support.  Treasurer Mike Nahan and Disability Services Minister Donna Faragher said the expanded cover started today for more than 1.8 million WA motorists.  Dr Nahan said the cost of the expanded insurance cover would be a maximum of $99 in the first year for each vehicle and motorcycle, with smaller increases for tractors, mopeds, vintage cars and farm firefighting vehicles. There will be no increases for caravans and trailers.  "The extra cost to vehicle registrations ensures WA's 1.8 million motorists will receive the care and support they need for the rest of their lives if they are catastrophically injured," he said.  "This scheme will change the lives of the estimated 44 people in WA each year who are catastrophically injured in car crashes, in which they were either at fault or unable to identify another driver at fault, and their loved ones.  "I would like to thank the broader community for their support in introducing this important scheme."  Mrs Faragher said the expanded cover would provide security to people who suffered those injuries, as well as their families and loved ones.  "The cost of care after catastrophic injury is enormous and beyond the financial means of most families, with an estimated average lifetime cost of $4 million per person," she said.  "This lifetime care and support offers peace of mind to WA families, and follows extensive consultation with the health and disability sector, motorists and the wider community."

996	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Call-for-community-input-on-NDIS-in-WA.aspx	People living with disability, their families, carers and disability service providers are being encouraged to provide feedback to shape the delivery of services under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) in Western Australia. Disability Services Minister Donna Faragher said while the Commonwealth and State governments continued to finalise governance arrangements for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, community members now had the opportunity to have their say on service delivery and key improvements to the scheme. "The Ministerial Advisory Council on Disability (MACD) has initiated a community engagement process, which encourages people to provide valuable input about what's working best on the ground and how we can improve the delivery of services," Mrs Faragher said. "MACD has developed a series of discussion papers, on key issues of importance to people with disability, to stimulate and guide discussion and feedback. "The first of these discussion papers have now been released. Community members can provide feedback in different ways including written submissions, via email, workshops, by telephone, personal interviews and online." The WA NDIS (formerly NDIS My Way) operates in the Lower South West region and Cockburn-Kwinana area.  From October 1, 2016, the WA Disability Services Commission will expand the NDIS model to local government areas Armadale, Murray and Serpentine-Jarrahdale. The National Disability Insurance Agency model delivered in the Perth Hills region will be expanded to Bayswater, Bassendean, Chittering, Toodyay, York and Northam from January 1, 2017. In 2016-17, the Liberal National Government is contributing $181 million to support the NDIS and over the next 12 months, more people will have the opportunity to participate through an extension and expansion of the current NDIS trials in WA. "We continue to learn from the ongoing comparative WA and Commonwealth-administered trials which currently involve 4,000 West Australians and will grow to 11,000 participants in mid-2017," the Minister said.

Local Government Minister Tony Simpson said the City of Perth had now been enlarged to include The University of Western Australia, Kings Park, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre and the new Perth Children's Hospital.  "Bringing some of Perth's key landmarks under the umbrella of the capital city is recognition of its special status as the centre of tourism, business and retail activity for Western Australia," Mr Simpson said. "This is a memorable moment, made possible due to extensive consultation with the City of Perth and relevant business, tourism and ratepayer associations. "Western Australia is now in line with all other mainland States which recognise the status of their capitals through Acts of Parliament." The Minister said the City of Perth Act 2016 also set out the unique role of the City of Perth, outlining the responsibilities that should guide the council's actions and decision making.  "Perth is the gateway to WA and the City of Perth has responsibility not only to its ratepayers, but to the thousands of people who visit the city for work and leisure every day," he said.

998	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Justice-in-WA-reaches-new-heights.aspx	The stunning new centrepiece of Perth's legal district was officially opened today by the Liberal National Government. The 33-storey David Malcolm Justice Centre will accommodate the Supreme Court's civil functions and judicial chambers as well as the departments of Treasury and the Attorney General, including the Office of the Public Advocate, the Solicitor General, the Commissioner for Victims of Crime, the State Solicitor's Office and the Parliamentary Counsel's Office. Attorney General Michael Mischin said the centre, named after the former Chief Justice of Western Australia, the late David Malcolm AC QC, was located in the heart of the city's justice precinct near the original Supreme Court and the State Administrative Tribunal, and highlighted the Government's unprecedented renewal of justice facilities across the State. "The David Malcolm Justice Centre will use the latest technology and will offer state-of-the-art service to the thousands of people who will use it every year," Mr Mischin said. "This magnificent tower building and the overall Cathedral Square rejuvenation has already provided a major economic boost, with more than 1,500 people employed on the project.  The $127 million fit out for the justice tower and State Administrative Tribunal is the largest undertaken in a single State Government project. "The facility is a fitting honour to the memory of a great West Australian in David Malcolm, and will provide contemporary justice services to the community for decades to come." The tower was designed to blend in with the surrounding heritage precinct and features impressive artwork in public access areas, including an 18-metre oil painting on level 4. While the State Government agencies are already moving into the tower, the Supreme Court civil will open its doors to the public on Monday, July 11. The Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages will remain in its current location at Westralia Square.

1000	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Research-canvasses-healthy-dose-of-arts-in-WA.aspx	New research has found that Western Australian public and private hospitals are increasingly using the arts in clinical settings to improve health education and outcomes for patients. Health and Culture and the Arts Minister John Day today received the report, Use of the Arts to Improve Health and Healing in Western Australian Hospitals, which maps current levels of arts activity in clinical environments in WA. Mr Day said the research highlighted considerable demand for arts activities in the health system from both the public and clinicians, with significant interventions already occurring from music therapy for oncology patients to artists in residence programs. "In my capacity as Minister for Culture and the Arts, I have supported a number of projects that utilised the arts to promote healthy outcomes and have witnessed their success," he said. "An outstanding example is the Western Desert Kidney Health Project, which tailored health care to the community and individuals in need as well as using the power of arts and storytelling to make health education and prevention both meaningful and successful. "The new Perth Children's Hospital also promises to be an outstanding example of the incorporation of arts into the healing environment." The report was commissioned by the WA Arts and Health Consortium Reference Group and funded by Lotterywest, the Liberal National Government through the departments of Culture and the Arts and Health, and St John of God Health Care. A total of 20 metropolitan public and private hospitals and six of seven WA Country Health Service regions representing 60 hospitals were contacted and invited to take part in the hospital questionnaire. Ninety per cent of hospitals responded, with three-quarters indicating they deliver arts and health activities.  "It is pleasing to see the Government's Percent for Art Scheme praised for delivering 'in spades'," Mr Day said. "It also notes the Royalties for Regions program has fostered strong community and arts sector engagement with the health system. "The key findings include high consumer support for arts interventions while in hospital as either a patient or a visitor but that, at present, there is little evidence of overall co-ordination, strategy or planning to underpin arts and health activities on hospital sites." The report found arts and health practice most evident in paediatrics, mental health, aged care and Aboriginal health, with some health professionals employing art in their clinical practice. "I look forward to considering the report's five recommendations, which focus on the potential of policy development and improved co-ordination to promote arts and health practice across WA," the Minister said.

Country local governments can now apply for funding through the Country Local Government Fund (CLGF) Youth Development Program, which will see the creation of 20 traineeships providing young people with career prospects in their local community.  "As a former councillor, I know the local government sector provides a variety of rewarding opportunities for young people who want to make a difference at a local level," Local Government Minister Tony Simpson said.   "This is an exciting investment by the Liberal National Government into the future of young people who may have otherwise not considered a career in local government."  Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Country Local Government Fund was helping regional local governments build their capacity and identify opportunities for development and initiatives.  "The Country Local Government Fund contributes towards building and maintaining a positive lifestyle for our regional communities and is an important investment for Royalties for Regions," Mr Redman said.  "Not only will this initiative enable participants to gain valuable skills through real life experience, it will enable them to stay in their community of choice through providing local job options." Under this initiative, country local governments can access up to $5,000 towards course fees per trainee and a $15,000 wage subsidy.  It also includes 40 scholarships of up to $10,000 each for young country local government employees to undertake training and 16 two-day workshops on leadership and career development.

1002	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Australian-first-performance-at-Elizabeth-Quay.aspx	A 50-tonne, fire-breathing spider will land at Elizabeth Quay this November for three exclusive shows, in an Australian-first by award-winning UK performance group Arcadia Spectacular. Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett announced the Perth performances today and said the shows would help put Perth in the global spotlight.  "Nothing like this has been seen in Australia before and it is a great coup for Western Australia to host this breathtaking cultural spectacle," Mr Barnett said. "The staging of The Giants and the growth of the Perth International Arts Festival and FRINGE WORLD, which was recognised as the third largest Fringe Festival in the world, have helped build Perth's reputation as an international cultural event destination. "The performances by Arcadia will further cement this reputation, and the media exposure will give us the opportunity to show the rest of world how our magnificent city is transforming." The Arcadia Spectacular shows, presented by The Event Agency, combine theatre, circus, music, aerial performance, robotics and pyrotechnics.  Artists perform in the spider's 'stomach' with the audience standing under and around the structure. Culture and the Arts Minister John Day said the shows would include a performance of Yallorr Keeninyarra (Dance of the Wadjuk Nyungar people) lead by Noongar representative Barry McGuire. "The dance calls on the Spider Spirit to weave a web of strength and togetherness for the men who gathered for traditional ceremonies at Gumap or Elizabeth Quay," Mr Day said. "It is the first time the dance has been performed traditionally in front of the West Australian public since 1901." The Premier said the Liberal National Government was proud to support the Arcadia Spectacular shows through Tourism WA, the Department of Culture and the Arts and Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority. "Local musicians will have the opportunity to be part of this once in a lifetime experience and perform on the same bill as some of the biggest names in music," Mr Barnett said.

1003	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/WA-artists-shine-in-national-Aboriginal-awards.aspx	Thirteen West Australian artists from as far afield as Marble Bar and the Ngaanyatjarra Lands are finalists in the 2016 annual National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA). Culture and the Arts Minister John Day today launched the awards' inaugural touring exhibition that starts in Perth and proceeds to Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. "Once again, West Australian artists feature highly in the finals, and I congratulate them on their achievements and wish them luck in the finals," Mr Day said. "These long-standing awards are regarded as one of the premier events in the Australian indigenous art calendar.  The installation here in WA gives visitors to the Perth Cultural Centre the chance to see some of the latest work by leading artists." The Minister said the annual NATSIAA, sponsored by the Northern Territory Government, and WA's bi-annual Indigenous Art Awards, sponsored by the State Government through the Art Gallery of WA, helped support a sustainable Aboriginal art sector. "Like NATSIAA, the WA Indigenous Art Awards are open to national entrants, and they have grown to the point where the gallery is developing plans for a new and expanded series," he said. "The gallery is also undertaking the six-year project, Desert River Sea, which is a partnership with artists, art centres and communities across the Kimberley." Mr Day said the Government also supported the Revealed: Emerging Aboriginal artists in Western Australia program through the Department of Culture and the Arts. "Revealed brings artists together from all over the State for a curated exhibition of their work, a symposium and a day-long public art market," he said. "It began as a bi-annual event but is now running annually and setting attendance and sales records." Minister's office - 6552 6200	{"minister": "Day", "portfolio": "Culture and the Arts"}	2016-06-28

The five-day China trade visit next week to meet with senior representatives of the People's Republic of China and business leaders is the first for both Ministers since taking up their respective portfolios in March. "China is our largest trading partner, with two-way trade valued at $59.4 billion in 2015," Mr Marmion said.  "While currently our exports are dominated by resource products such as iron ore, there are many opportunities to expand our relationship in areas like agribusiness, education and training and technology." The Ministers will visit Ningbo, a port city in China's east, before travelling to the capital, Beijing for a series of high-level meetings with government and industry. Mr Nalder said the visit would provide an insight into how Chinese companies viewed Western Australia as a safe supplier of quality, safe and reliable food. "Ningbo lies in the Zhejiang Province, which has been a Sister State of Western Australia for almost 30 years," he said.  "A number of companies in Zhejiang are working with the cattle supply chain in WA to commence exports of beef into China." In Beijing, the Ministers will meet officials from key Chinese ministries including Commerce and Agriculture, as well as representatives from the National Development and Reform Commission and State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The Ministers will also meet major Chinese petroleum, resource, agricultural and finance companies investing in, or supporting investment in, Western Australia.

1005	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/New-laws-target-meth-transit-routes-into-WA.aspx	The Liberal National Government has again cemented its tough on crime credentials by introducing legislation into State Parliament today which will help disrupt the supply of methamphetamine into Western Australia. Deputy Premier and Police Minister Liza Harvey said the new laws would make it easier for WA Police to target and detect meth being distributed through the State's regional road network and postage system.  Mrs Harvey said under the proposed laws, a road suspected of being a drug transit route could be declared a search area for a limited time by a senior police officer, allowing police to search any vehicle travelling through it.  "Meth is rarely manufactured in Western Australia since this Government cracked down on backyard laboratories.  However, we believe an amount of meth and other drugs are being transported through WA undetected because WA Police must build a case of reasonable suspicion for every individual vehicle before they can search them," she said.  "The new laws mean police have to have a reasonable suspicion the road network, such as interstate border crossings or roads into remote communities, are being used by drug traffickers." The Minister said the legislation also targeted freight and courier distribution facilities. "A senior officer will be able to authorise the search of a freight or courier distribution facility for a maximum period of 24 hours.  However, officers could only open individual packages once they have a reasonable suspicion drugs have been detected in them," she said. Mrs Harvey said the Government had consulted with major freight and courier companies, who strongly supported the legislation. "The initial searches on vehicles and freight facilities could include officers, drug detection dogs and electronic equipment.  If these methods result in a reasonable suspicion drugs that are present, further searches, such as opening packaging, could then occur," she said. "Meth is ruining lives and putting significant pressure on public services and the Liberal National Government has committed to giving police the resources they need to help combat this insidious drug."

1006	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Grants-for-improved-cycling-facilities.aspx	A total of 30 local governments will receive a share of more than $3.5 million over two years to further improve Western Australia's bicycle network, as a result of the Department of Transport's 2016-17 grants program. Each year, the Liberal National Government provides grant funding assistance to local government authorities for cycling infrastructure and the development of bike plans through the Perth Bicycle Network and Regional Bicycle Network grants.  Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the 2016-17 investment would see the creation of 15 kilometres of shared paths which would separate cyclists from motorists. "This cash injection into WA's cycling network will help ensure local infrastructure meets the needs of the State's growing cycling community," Mr Nalder said. The funding enables the further design and construction of a one kilometre-long, 2.5 metre-wide recreational shared path on West Swan Road, Henley Brook between Saunders Street and Gnangara Road.  Planning and design funding has also been allocated for a shared path along Gnangara Road, Henley Brook between West Swan Road and Henley Brook Avenue by two kilometres to link with Ellenbrook. Other significant projects include: Overall, the State Government has committed $44.6 million until 2019-20 for the Principal Shared Path program, local government grants and the bike boulevards program.

1007	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Water-infrastructure-charges-reduced.aspx	There will be a significant reduction in the charge for providing a water supply for new developments or subdivisions from July 1, 2016, as part of the 2016-17 State Budget. Water Minister Mia Davies today announced the rate of standard infrastructure contributions charged to developers for new water supply infrastructure would reduce by 47 per cent.  "These are what are commonly known in the building industry as headwork charges and they will be reduced from $4,064 to $2,150 per lot," she said.  "This reduction reflects the decrease in the costs incurred by the Water Corporation to provide water supply infrastructure.  The corporation has been working closely with the development industry and this is a great outcome for new housing subdivisions across Western Australia." Standard infrastructure contributions are one-off charges paid by developers when subdividing or creating new lots or buildings with a service demand greater than a single residence.  The Minister also announced a long-standing anomaly would also be revised, meaning rural residential subdivisions would attract the standard infrastructure contribution charge, instead of full cost recovery. "This is great news for regional WA because it removes red tape and a potential impediment to the expansion and growth in regional towns as it becomes more attractive to develop rural residential subdivisions," she said. Ms Davies said the costs for regional subdivisions varied significantly from town to town and could be as much as $20,000 per lot in some areas. The change could encourage more local governments and landowners to subdivide, producing a greater variety of lot sizes in regional areas.

The new award recognises successful community programs run by resource companies that provide ongoing benefits to local communities, during and beyond the life of the associated resource projects. The winner will be announced by Mines and Petroleum Minister Sean L'Estrange in October at the Department of Mines and Petroleum's first ever Awards For Excellence night, which will also incorporate the Golden Gecko Awards for Environmental Excellence. Mr L'Estrange said the new award highlighted the many positive social outcomes created by resource projects in regional areas. "The department has launched this award to recognise projects that bring resource companies and their local communities together," Mr L'Estrange said. "Applications have come from across Western Australia including the South-West, Goldfields-Esperance, Mid-West, Pilbara and Kimberley and feature many unique partnerships which will leave positive and lasting benefits." The projects nominated include collaborations with indigenous groups, schools and other educational and training organisations, and a number of cultural, conservation, restoration and social partnerships. Nominations for the 2016 award have closed, and in a transparent assessment process, all submissions will be assessed on the positive outcomes the collaborative partnerships are delivering to the broader community.  Assessment criteria includes leadership and innovation in engagement, benefits of the collaboration and the project's commitment to providing sustainable and enduring outcomes. "Resource companies become involved with communities at various levels and this award showcases and celebrates partnerships which bring long-lasting mutual benefits to resource companies and the local communities in which they operate," he said.

The International Youth Exchange Program is an initiative of the Liberal National Government and the Home Affairs Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to further strengthen relations between China and Western Australia.  Youth Minister Tony Simpson said applications for the program were now open to students who could demonstrate they were actively engaged in their communities.

"It is the first of its kind between WA and Hong Kong and will facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences on an international level. "I strongly encourage young people across the State to apply, particularly those from regional areas as well as Aboriginal and multicultural backgrounds."  Under the program, Western Australian delegates will have the opportunity to meet and participate in activities with Hong Kong delegates when they visit Perth in October 2016 before travelling to Hong Kong in February 2017.  Citizenship and Multicultural Interests Minister Mike Nahan said the program would help build intercultural understanding among young people.

"A number of the projects and proposals have been jointly submitted by groups of art centres, which means the majority of WA's art centres will receive help through the program." Regional Development Minister Terry Redman welcomed the strong response and said Aboriginal art centres were important hubs for community and cultural activity in regional WA.    "Aboriginal art centres play a significant role in developing the skills of artists, maintaining traditional culture across generations and contributing towards regional WA's economic and social prosperity," Mr Redman said.  "This Royalties for Regions investment is helping to support the growth of Aboriginal culture in regional communities."

Culture and the Arts Minister John Day encouraged all West Australians to get behind the project in the heart of the Perth Cultural Centre and help shape the stories that will represent WA for generations to come. "Today is bittersweet as we say farewell to the existing museum that many of us have grown up with, and prepare for the amazing new facility that is fit for 2020 and beyond," Mr Day said.  "The Liberal National Government is investing $428.3 million to ensure our State has a museum that meets the expectations of West Australians and visitors to our State, and delivers exciting experiences which will inspire people of all ages to explore and share the world in which we live."  Thousands of people are expected to visit the museum's Perth site today to take part in farewell celebrations including entertainment, dinosaur encounters, craft activities and an Aboriginal art program.  Museum staff will also be conducting tours of the heritage buildings, including the old Perth gaol - one of WA's oldest buildings and the place the WA Museum began 125 years ago with a collection of minerals and rocks. The plans for the new museum will see it become up to four times bigger than the current museum and will include a new building that will integrate with the four heritage-listed buildings already on site.  The State Government is currently in negotiations with Brookfield Multiplex regarding the Managing Contract agreement, which is expected to be awarded in mid-2016.   "All of the displays, experiences and spaces will reflect the environment, culture and history of WA and its relationship to the world," the Minister said.  "Due to overwhelming public demand, the one object that definitely has a free pass into the new museum is the iconic blue whale skeleton."

The strategy aims to allow commercial and recreational marine activities to grow while sustaining the ecological values of the marine environment, and to improve industry and community confidence in the sustainable development of Western Australia's marine environment. It also aims to improve efficiency in compliance and infrastructure and position WA as a globally renowned hub focused on marine science and innovation.

1025	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Legislation-paves-the-way-for-energy-reforms.aspx	Legislation enabling the transfer of the regulation of Western Australia's electricity network to the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has today been introduced to State Parliament by the Liberal National Government.  Energy Minister Mike Nahan said the legislation would allow WA to adopt the National Electricity Law for the regulation of Western Power's electricity network, bringing the State in line with all other States and Territories, and helping pave the way for a more efficient energy sector.  Dr Nahan said the change would offer significant benefits for electricity consumers and the State's economy by improving access to the network for low-cost renewable generation and reducing connection costs.  "Through the Liberal National Government's Electricity Market Review (EMR), we are working to ensure WA's electricity industry embraces the exciting technological advances and changes in the way people are using electricity," he said. "It is critical the regulation of Western Power's network is measured against national benchmarks to ensure network costs are kept at efficient levels.  The AER will ensure electricity consumers pay no more than necessary for access to Western Power's poles and wires for the safe and reliable delivery of electricity. "This legislation demonstrates the State Government's commitment to regulatory reform across critical sectors of the Western Australian economy to become more efficient, open and transparent while ensuring best practices are adopted."  The Minister said the safety and reliability of the Western Power network would continue to be monitored and regulated by State Government agencies, with existing safety standards remaining. "The National Electricity Law will improve access to the Western Power network for low-cost renewable generation, and reduce connection costs for businesses and household electricity customers," he said.  Dr Nahan said the AER would be the economic regulator for WA's electricity network and gas pipelines, meaning better regulatory decision-making through access to the capability, experience and regulatory expertise of a specialised energy market regulator.

Heritage Minister Albert Jacob said Bunbury's Lady Mitchell Memorial Child Health Centre had been recognised through its inclusion in the State Register of Heritage Places. "The care of our children is an integral component of the growth and wellbeing of communities, and this building is significant for the continued service it has provided as a health clinic for the women and children of Bunbury and surrounding areas," Mr Jacob said. The clinic was built in the 1950s post-war era in response to a major government initiative to establish a network of maternal and infant welfare services in the State. "This network of infant health centres was one of the most significant public health initiatives in the 20th century, playing an important role in reducing infant mortality and improving the quality of life for children and parents," the Minister said. The Lady Mitchell building was officially opened in February 1952 and was named after Lady Clara Mitchell, former wife of premier and Governor of Western Australia Sir James Mitchell, who had strong links with Bunbury and the South-West.  "Lady Clara Mitchell was a woman who devoted herself to her community, so it was appropriate that this building was named after in her honour," Mr Jacob said. "Many local people may also remember the late long-serving infant health nurse Rosalind (Rose) Blanche Lewin, who worked at the clinic from the 1950s and was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia in 1978 for services to the community. "The Lady Mitchell Memorial Child Health Centre has provided an essential service to mothers and children over the decades.  Generations of women continue to use this centre and it will remain an important resource in the Bunbury region."

Attending the dedication of the painting today, Health and Culture and the Arts Minister John Day said the work - by celebrated West Australian artist Mary Moore - was an important addition to the State's newest and largest tertiary hospital.

1029	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Regional-centres-enriched-by-competitions.aspx	Regional West Australians will have the chance to experience national sporting events thanks to the latest round of the Liberal National Government's Country Sport Enrichment Scheme (CSES).  Sport and Recreation Minister Mia Davies today announced three State Sporting Associations had collectively received $60,000 in funding for events across the State.  "The CSES supports organisations to deliver international, national or State sporting events and competitions, alongside sport development opportunities to regional Western Australia," Ms Davies said. "This round, Volleyball WA will receive $25,000 towards an Australian Volleyball League game in Albany on October 15 and 16. "Swimming WA will receive $25,000 for the 2016/17 Regional Open Water Series, which provides opportunities for regional West Australians to participate in open water events with elite Australian swimmers.  "The series will run from October 2016 to April 2017 with events in Geraldton (October 1, 2016), Mandurah (November 6, 2016), Busselton (November 13, 2016), Albany (January 2, 2017), Harvey (January 14, 2017), Bunbury (January 21, 2017) and Carnarvon (April 22, 2017). "WestCycle will also receive $10,000 towards the Southern Mountain Bike festival (formerly Albany Urban Downhill) in Albany from September 23-25." In keeping with CSES guidelines, all events will also include community activation events such as coaching forums and clinics, school and junior clinics, capacity building workshops and sport specific demonstrations.  "Not only do events like this foster a love for sport but they also help to inspire locals to get active using both our built facilities and WA's amazing natural landscape," the Minister said.

1030	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Early-settler-cottage-State-heritage-listed.aspx	One of Western Australia's oldest surviving colonial residences, Morby Farm Cottage in Northam, has been celebrated by its inclusion in the State Register of Heritage Places. Heritage Minister Albert Jacob said Morby Farm Cottage was an important heritage site because it was built in 1836 by John Morrell, the first European to settle in Northam in 1832. "Morrell was a carpenter who had high ambitions to become a farmer in the new colony that had only been settled a year before he left England," Mr Jacob said. "The life of the Morrell family and the journey they took to Western Australia with their possessions, cattle and farm equipment, and their dreams of setting up a new life is a rich colonial story." John Morrell built the farmhouse using locally sourced materials, but the doors and window frames and panes travelled with him by ship, on his long and arduous journey from England. The cottage was crucial to the early colonial life in Northam, serving as the town's first church, school, courthouse, and retail and postal outlet. "The characters who established this farming property, John and Frederick Morrell and William and Peter Chidlow, underpin the founding story of this region," the Minister said.  "For early colonists, the productive farming land in the Northam district provided exciting agricultural prospects, but it was difficult establishing settlements so far from the Swan River colony.  Morby Cottage became central to the expanding district's needs." John Morrell died in 1843 from pneumonia after rescuing a drowning man in the Avon River.  A memorial was erected on his grave site in 1929 and is entered in the State Register as John Morrell's Grave.  Morby Farm Cottage has been owned and managed by the Shire of Northam since 1978 and now operates as a museum, which is open to the public each Sunday from 10.30am to 4pm.

1031	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Community-groups-build-WAs-multiculturalism.aspx	Western Australia's cultural diversity will be supported and developed thanks to new funding awarded today by the Liberal National Government to nine community organisations. Citizenship and Multicultural Interests Minister Mike Nahan said the valued organisations, including the Hellenic Community of WA, the Hindi Samaj of WA, and the Curtin Student Guild International Student Committee, would share in grants totalling $110,000.  Dr Nahan said the Community Grants Program (CGP) would support a number of cultural activities that attracted thousands of people and offered exciting opportunities for the wider community to learn about and experience other cultures. "Cultural activities, such as the Glendi Greek Festival, the Australia-Japan Society of WA's 2016 Perth Kodomo Festival and the WA French Festival's Bonjour Perth, are now a fixture on WA's events calendar," the Minister said. "These events allow the whole community to come together to experience the diverse traditions and heritages of our State.  "This year, we have also focused on projects that aim to engage cultural and linguistically diverse (CaLD) communities, such as collaborations with Public Libraries WA and Alzheimer's WA to improve access to resources, facilities and services, and encourage participation and volunteering. "Among the small projects to be supported includes My Story, My Home, a partnership between the World Press Photo Perth Inc., the City of Belmont, Edith Cowan University and the Australian Islamic College Kewdale campus, which aims to share the diverse stories of young Muslims with the community to build awareness, understanding and acceptance; and Clubs WA's My Club, My Community project, which will work to encourage CaLD community members to join their local club as a member or volunteer. "The August 2016 round of the CGP opens on Monday, July 4 and I encourage other community organisations to apply for funding." The grants are administered via the Office of Multicultural Interests' CGP, which supports culturally diverse communities to develop skills, maintain their cultures and address their needs.

1032	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Rare-documents-map-WAs-400-year-Dutch-links.aspx	West Australians will be able to delve into the rich history of Dutch exploration of the State and gain a greater understanding of the contribution migrants from The Netherlands have made, through the new State Library of Western Australia exhibition, Dutch Journeys to the Western Edge. Opening the exhibition today, Culture and the Arts Minister John Day said one of its most significant pieces was a 263-year-old map, one of two rare documents recently acquired by the library and on display for the first time. "This precious map was the first detailed drawing of the WA coastline and is a key part of our documentary heritage," Mr Day said. "It was prepared in 1753 by Johannes van Keulen, mapmaker for the Dutch East India Company, using explorer Willem de Vlamingh's manuscript chart of his 1696-97 voyage. "Also on display is the historic 1703 Thornton map, which includes many Dutch discoveries along the WA coast." The new exhibition is a major part of this year's commemorations to mark the 400th anniversary of Dirk Hartog's historic landing at Shark Bay on October 25, 1616. "While it explores in detail these early maritime links, this exciting exhibition also includes many inspiring and engaging stories highlighting more contemporary Dutch connections with WA," the Minister said. "Recognising the important contribution that migrant communities have made to this State, the exhibition uses innovative displays to help bring 400 years of WA's Dutch history to life." Mr Day said the van Keulen and Thornton maps would undergo conservation work, before being digitised and made available for free access on the State Library website.

1033	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Eco-tick-for-Mandurahs-crab-fishery.aspx	Fisheries Minister Joe Francis today congratulated the Mandurah Licensed Fisherman's Association and Recfishwest for their efforts to secure third party sustainability certification for Peel-Harvey Estuary's blue swimmer crab fishery. "It's great to see the commercial and recreational sectors working together.  It's a fantastic achievement for them to be recognised through the highest benchmark for ecologically sustainable fishing - Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification," Mr Francis said.  "This MSC certification is an 'eco-tick' of approval.  It confirms Mandurah's prized blue swimmer crab fishery - which is shared by recreational and commercial fishers - is well managed and sustainable.  "The certification, which was funded as part of a $14.5 million third party certification program, is another example of the Liberal National Government's commitment to providing better fishing opportunities to West Australians. "The joint effort by the commercial and recreational sectors to gain MSC certification is recognition of the sustainability of the fishery and its social and economic importance to people in the Peel region."    The Minister thanked community members and groups who took part in the MSC's public consultation process for the blue swimmer crab fishery to ensure a rigorous outcome that took account of important environmental considerations.   "Recreational and commercial fishers and other stakeholders all need the confidence that sustainability provides," he said. Mr Francis said Peel-Harvey Estuary's sea mullet fishery had also been awarded an 'eco-tick' - the first finfish fishery in WA to receive MSC certification. A number of other WA commercial fisheries are currently undergoing full assessment. "This trend for independent third party certification is continuing to strengthen around the world, so it is vital we seek certification for the State's key fisheries," the Minister said. Last year, WA's western rock lobster fishery became the first in the world to be recognised internationally for 15 years of continuous MSC certification.

The vessels will replace HMAS Success which will reach the end of its life in 2021.    Mr Mischin said the Australian Government had indicated that some of the works connected to this program could be undertaken in Western Australia.   "I would like to see WA secure a significant portion of this work and have advocated to Mr Revuelta Lapique the State's ability to build, maintain and upgrade naval vessels," he said.  "The five-year sustainment contract for the two vessels will be undertaken by Navantia in Australia, and it has been shortlisted as one of three European companies for the Commonwealth Competitive Evaluation Process for the SEA 5000 Future Frigates program.  "Royal Australian Navy vessels including the Collins Class submarines and ANZAC frigates have been successfully repaired and maintained in this State for many years, and I believe we have the experience and established infrastructure to take part in this new program."  Navantia's trip follows preliminary visits to the State by other industry representatives in relation to the $3 billion future Offshore Patrol Vessels. Ten of the 12 vessels are expected to be built in WA from 2020, creating hundreds of jobs.     Minister's office - 6552 5600	{"minister": "Mischin", "portfolio": "Commerce"}	2016-06-24
1035	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Scholarships-for-agrifood-innovation.aspx	Premier and Science Minister Colin Barnett today announced the launch of the first round of the Premier's Agriculture and Aquaculture Entrepreneurship Program, made possible by the Liberal National Government's Royalties for Regions program. The program is making 12 $30,000 scholarships available over four years to enable farmers and innovators involved in the agriculture or aquaculture sectors to develop or pursue an idea, technology or practice through exposure to international best practice and leaders in their field. The Premier said successful applicants would have an innovative concept or idea within the fields of agriculture or aquaculture that had the potential to broaden the economy and to modernise the agrifood sector.  "The program will see successful applicants learning from international leaders in agriculture and aquaculture," Mr Barnett said. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the program represented yet another exciting opportunity to broaden the State's economy, made possible by the Royalties for Regions program's $350 million Seizing the Opportunity Agriculture initiative. "This investment will support entrepreneurship and innovation in regional Western Australia and in our agriculture sector, directly benefitting regional communities both now and into the future," Mr Redman said. "This program is another example of the State Government's unprecedented investment in the agricultural sector under the $350 million Seizing the Opportunity Agriculture initiative, and will create new and expanded industry sectors. Applications for round one of the entrepreneurship program close 12pm AWST on August 5, 2016.

In his opening address, Innovation Minister Bill Marmion commended the innovation and ingenuity displayed by all the shortlisted nominees, and wished the winners the best of luck as they now competed on the national stage. "Special congratulations go to Reflex for winning the Minister's Award for Excellence in Innovation.  This is a fantastic example of West Australians leveraging our natural mining advantage to springboard into new business opportunities. Initiatives such as this have the ability to fundamentally transform the economy of our State," Mr Marmion said. Reflex's winning Reflexhub-IQ solution uses cloud technology to enable mining companies to easily and quickly collect, store and report critical operational, geological and assay data - saving time and money.   The winner of the Most Effective Government Solution category was WA Police and Australia Post for their successful introduction of an online National Police Certificate. This is now being considered for adoption interstate. "West Australians requiring a National Police Certificate have had their wait time reduced from five days to 30 minutes on average, as a result of this application," the Minister said.  "This initiative is another example of how government is using technology to cut red tape and save the community time and money." Special mention also goes to Landgate and their collaboration with Ajilon Australia in creating a new land registry system, speeding up the process in which land transactions are lodged and executed from seven days to less than 30 seconds.   Minister's office - 6552 6800	{"minister": "Marmion", "portfolio": "Innovation"}	2016-06-25
1037	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/New-drug-dogs-help-sniff-out-meth.aspx	Drug detection dogs Dakota and Quokka have been unveiled by the Liberal National Government as the newest recruits in the fight against methylamphetamine in the community. Deputy Premier and Police Minister Liza Harvey said the dogs had undergone an intensive training program and had already disrupted the supply of meth into the Western Australian community. "Since Dakota and Quokka graduated in April, they have helped take meth, ecstasy, heroin, cocaine and cannabis off the streets, as well as sniffing out cash suspected to be the profits of drug dealers," Mrs Harvey said. "Drug detection dogs play a crucial role in the battle against meth and are working extensively with WA Police's recently formed Meth Teams, which target both high-level trafficking and local drug dealers." The Minister said the drug detection dogs, which scratch and bite at the source of the odour of drugs and cash, were deployed with the Meth Teams nine times per month in 2015 and this had increased to 12 times per month so far in 2016. "This is in line with the WA Police meth enforcement plan which created a range of police teams dedicated to disrupting the supply of this chaotic drug into Western Australia," she said. Mrs Harvey said Dakota and Quokka were part of a $1.2 million Liberal National Government commitment to boost the canine section with nine general purpose dogs, two narcotic detection dogs, and refurbished kennels. The Minister said the dogs were part of the Government's WA Meth Strategy to tackle meth on three fronts including education, support for addicts and their families, and disrupting supply.

1038	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Independent-Trustee-named-for-native-title-deal.aspx	Premier Colin Barnett today announced Perpetual Trustee Company Limited as the first Noongar Boodja Trustee (Trustee) after a formal selection process undertaken by the Western Australian Government and the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council (SWALSC). "The selection process has been a significant undertaking because it is a critical component of the implementation of the South West Native Title Settlement, the most comprehensive agreement to settle Aboriginal interests over land, in Australia's history," Mr Barnett said. "The settlement, which comprises the full and final resolution of all native title claims in the State's South-West, provides Noongar people with $1.3 billion in assets including a future fund of $50 million each year for 12 years, and up to 320,000 hectares of Crown land.  "Under the agreement, Perpetual Trustee Company Limited's role, once it is formally appointed as Trustee, will be principally around asset management and development, and administering the distribution process to the Noongar corporations. "The Trustee is expected to work in partnership with the Noongar people, and bring all its resources, expertise, and experience to enable them to build their economic, social and cultural future through enduring relationships with Government, business and the community." The Premier said Perpetual Trustee Company Limited could be described as a 'Trustee in Waiting' because its formal appointment would begin after the South-West settlement commenced. This would be after the registration of the six Indigenous Land Use Agreements with the National Native Title Tribunal. "The announcement of the selection of the Noongar Boodja Trustee comes just weeks after the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Act 2016 and Land Administration (South West Native Title Settlement) Act 2016 were proclaimed on June 6, 2016," Mr Barnett said. "It was highly symbolic that the Noongar Recognition Act was proclaimed on WA Day this year. The Act recognises and honours the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West, and provides them with an historic, overdue recognition of the significant and unique contribution that they have made, and will continue to make, to the heritage, cultural identity, community and economy of WA."

1039	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Revealed-Aboriginal-art-sales-and-visits-triple.aspx	The 2016 Revealed: Emerging Aboriginal Artists from Western Australia exhibition hosted by the Fremantle Arts Centre in April, has achieved a three-fold jump in sales and attendance over the previous 2015 event.  Announcing the figures today, Culture and the Arts Minister John Day said the significant growth in interest was a positive result for artists and communities across the State. "Revealed brings together artists from more than 20 WA Aboriginal Art Centres, including from a number of extremely remote areas, and gives them the opportunity to showcase and sell their work direct to the public," Mr Day said. More than 2,500 visitors came to view the Revealed exhibition on the opening weekend, with more than 19,500 attending during the event's 51-day run. Overall, artworks valued at more than $367,000 were sold in both the exhibition and the day-long art market, which is part of the Revealed program.  Art market sales alone were $316,000, compared with $132,327 in 2014. "I am pleased to announce that the Art Gallery of Western Australia also purchased a piece of Revealed artwork which will become part of the State Collection," the Minister said. "I congratulate Kimberley Gooniyandi artist and author Mervyn Street, and look forward to seeing his wonderful triptych on display in the Art Gallery." The Liberal National Government has contributed funding for Revealed since its inception in 2008. "Up until last year, this was a bi-annual event but after years of growth and the tremendous recent results, the decision to run it annually has certainly been vindicated," Mr Day said. "Revealed has grown in stature and public recognition, with the exhibition now a significant event showcasing the diversity of the best emerging and established Aboriginal artists and arts workers.  I congratulate the Fremantle Arts Centre on such a successful event."

1040	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Year-one-of-Creative-Regions-delivers-arts-jobs.aspx	The first year of the Liberal National Government's Creative Regions program has delivered more than $3.6 million to regional performing arts venues and arts organisations since June 2015.  Culture and the Arts Minister John Day said the $24 million program was one of the biggest investments in regional culture and arts made by a government in Australia. "The Creative Regions program has been tailored to address the cultural and arts needs of regional WA," he said.  "It is delivering a viable touring circuit, well-equipped venues, more shows and support for regional artists and communities.  "The program's five schemes make funding available for technical upgrades of performing arts venues, business and professional development, building the capacity of local arts groups, increasing the number of touring performances, and assisting Aboriginal arts centres." The first scheme, the Regional Venues Improvement Fund (RVIF), supports regional local government with grants totalling more than $940,000 to assist with a range of projects in Port Hedland, Narrogin, Albany, Geraldton, Merredin, Mandurah and Bunbury. "A second round of RVIF grants is due to close for evaluation at the end of June," Mr Day said.  "These projects will ensure the venues can accommodate new technologies often used by local and touring arts groups."   Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Creative Regions program was helping lay a strong foundation for country Western Australia's arts future. "As more of the schemes' components are completed and new projects roll out during the next three years, we will see even more benefits for communities economically, culturally and socially," Mr Redman said. "The Creative Regions program is making a valuable contribution to the wellbeing and revitalisation of regional areas, by helping to attract and retain skilled workers and their families." Key project partners Country Arts WA and CircuitWest are helping deliver two of the five schemes on behalf of overall program manager, the Department of Culture and the Arts. As part of the second scheme, CircuitWest was funded $579,000 for the first year to deliver a range of professional development programs to support regional local government venues and staff. Scheme three supports business development and market diversification for Aboriginal Art Centres with a further $629,000 allocated in grants that will benefit WA Aboriginal arts centres, following strong applications for a number of significant projects. As part of scheme four, Country Arts WA recently announced its second Regional Arts Legacy grants program, providing more than $830,000 to 12 arts organisations across seven regions. This follows on from $325,011 to 17 organisations across eight of the State's nine regions, providing additional support to expand existing activities such as writers' festivals, visual arts programs and skills development workshops.  An expanded Regional and Remote Touring Fund has provided $313,000 to tour four productions as part of the fifth scheme, including:  Culture and the Arts Minister's office - 6552 6200 Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700	{"minister": "Day; Redman", "portfolio": "Culture and the Arts; Regional Development"}	2016-06-29
1041	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Symbolic-name-for-new-womens-prison.aspx	Corrective Services Minister Joe Francis has announced that Western Australia's new women's prison will be called the Melaleuca Remand and Reintegration Facility. Mr Francis said the name 'melaleuca', also known as paperbark, honey-myrtle or tea-tree, was important in its symbolism. "This is a plant that is highly resilient, can flourish in a wide range of challenging habitats and is recognised for its healing properties," he said. "Women offenders often have specific needs relating to trauma, domestic violence, substance abuse, homelessness and unemployment. "I believe that the resilience of the melaleuca will instil a sense of hope for the future in female prisoners, and that the healing properties of the plant will reflect the culture of rehabilitation at the prison." Aboriginal people were consulted in choosing the facility's name, which was recommended by the Department of Corrective Services' Women's Estate Reference Committee. The committee was established in 2015 to provide advice on initiatives affecting the women's estate, with its members having expertise in a range of fields, including the legal profession, academia and Aboriginal organisations.   "Melaleuca will operate on a philosophy that focuses on the distinct needs of women newly received into prison or about to be released," the Minister said. "Preferred provider Sodexo will develop partnerships with Western Australian non-government organisations to provide culturally appropriate rehabilitation and reintegration services and programs at the facility. "The purpose is to support women to lead law-abiding lives on release to reduce the risk of reoffending."

1042	https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2016/06/Time-for-women-to-Get-Onboard-and-Lead.aspx	State Sporting Associations will be targeted under a new initiative designed to increase the number of women in leadership roles in the sport and recreation sector. The Get Onboard and Lead (GOAL) program has been launched by Sport and Recreation Minister Mia Davies and will build on existing systems already in place in the industry, to make it easier for all women to advance as leaders on and off the field.  "Western Australia enjoyed the best female participation rates in Australia in 2015, yet less than 32 per cent of total board roles in the industry were occupied by females," Ms Davies said. "Further, more than 60 of our 80 State Sports Associations surveyed in 2015 had less than 50 per cent female board representation, and 11 of those 80 State Sporting Associations surveyed did not have a single female board member. "There is clear evidence that shows the benefits for organisations from having a diversity of people and opinions in decision-making positions - and that's why I have launched GOAL." The first recommendations under GOAL include: Deputy Premier and Women's Interests Minister Liza Harvey said GOAL was an example of the Liberal National Government's commitment to promote the leadership of women in the community. "The promotion and further inclusion of women on sporting boards and in senior management positions in sport, will result in a greater diversity of ideas and in decision making of those organisations," Mrs Harvey said. A GOAL advisory group was set up by the Minister for Sport and Recreation late last year and will identify 10 key industry individuals to promote and champion women in leadership positions.  The Department of Sport and Recreation will also work with State Sporting Associations (SSAs) and a human resources expert, to identify opportunities for diversification. "A toolkit has been developed to help organisations and individuals get engaged with the GOAL program. There will be pages on the department's website with tips, downloadables, video and checklists available for SSAs and clubs and individuals," Ms Davies said. "For the GOAL program to work, we need to partner with State Sporting Associations, businesses and individuals who are passionate about ensuring strong female representation in WA.  I encourage everyone to engage with the program as the rewards will far outweigh the challenges of change."
