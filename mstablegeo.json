        "statement": "A bold new medical initiative is set to attract more clinical trials to Western Australia and build on the State's international reputation for research excellence. Health Minister John Day said the Liberal National Government had committed $1.3 million over three years to establish WA's first Clinical Trials and Data Centre. \"Clinical trials are a vital component of a strong, safe and sustainable health system.\u00a0 They ensure the quality of existing treatment regimes as well as the safety and efficacy of proposed new treatments,\" Mr Day said. The new centre will be established under the auspices of the Western Australian Health Translation Network, an alliance of the State's universities, medical research institutes, private and public hospitals and the Western Australian Department of Health. The network was started last year to streamline the incorporation of advanced health and medical research into clinical practice. \"One of the new centre's key roles will be to attract national and international trials to WA.\u00a0 It will achieve this by co-ordinating a wide variety of clinical trials and by tapping into the State's already advanced health and biological statistics and data management systems,\" he said. The Minister announced the new initiative to delegates attending the annual dinner of the Australian Society for Medical Research. The new centre is the latest component of the State Government's FutureHealth WA program. \"It will promote innovation across WA's growing health and medical research sector, supporting our many talented researchers while helping attract new expertise,\" Mr Day said. The Minister also awarded two $2,000 student prizes, sponsored by the Department of Health, to mark the end of the successful 2016 ASMR WA Medical Research Week.\u00a0 The recipients were Dr Rhonda Taylor from the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research and Anthony Buzzai of the Telethon Kids Institute. \"These awards recognise outstanding contributions to this week's research symposium by two higher-degree students or early-career academics,\" he said. \"This prize-winning, early stage work augers well for WA's medical research and development future.\" Minister's office - 6552 6200",

The project, which will generate about 20 jobs, is being funded by the Liberal National Government's Bridge Safety Improvement Program. The refurbishment work will be managed by Main Roads Western Australia and is due to be completed by December 2016. The contract for the $2.1 million refurbishment project was awarded to local construction company Watpac Civil and Mining. Minister's office - 6552 6400",

The history of the Guildford has been woven into the restored hotel with original tiles, fireplaces, doors and windows retained.\u00a0 Giant jarrah roof beams and charred convict-made bricks have become features of the refurbished hotel. \"I congratulate the owner and the Publican Group for taking on the conservation and refurbishment of Guildford Hotel, sensitively adapting and returning this heritage asset to the community,\" Mr Jacob said.

        "statement": "A completed stormwater harvesting project in the Shire of Beverley will provide more than 22 million litres of extra water per year for use by the community. Water Minister Mia Davies officially launched the project today, which was supported by a $100,000 grant through the Liberal National Government's Community Water Supply Program. \"In this drying climate, having a secure water supply for our ovals, parks and community needs is something we have to work harder to achieve,\" Ms Davies said. \"Innovative use of natural and man-made features to harvest stormwater now means Beverley has a substantial volume of water that was never available in the past. \"This harvested water that used to run down the street can now meet up to 50 per cent of the town's public open space irrigation needs, as well as provide water for emergencies.\" The Beverley stormwater harvesting project involved construction of two stormwater retention basins with a combined capacity of four million litres to capture water from the town's streets. As the basins fill during high rainfall events, water is pumped to existing tanks at sports ovals and to the 20 megalitre town dam to optimise storage.  The Shire of Beverley contributed $209,143 to create the innovative water harvesting project, which results in an extra 22.5 million litres of water being available for use. \"This will greatly improve the town's self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on costly and valuable scheme water for non-potable needs,\" the Minister said. Optimisation of storage in the 20 megalitre capacity town dam may in the future also provide emergency livestock water for farmers during dry periods, and water for firefighting needs.  The Community Water Supply Program is managed by the Department of Water. Minister's office - 6552 5500",

        "statement": "International medical graduates in the Goldfields region will continue to have access to high-quality education thanks to the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. The Forward to Fellowship program, facilitated by Rural Health West, provides international medical graduates with personal, professional and training support to help their integration into Australian medical general practice. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government's $532,100 investment would support the growing number of new international medical graduates practising in the area by offering further education in the region. \"The Forward to Fellowship program helps these graduates form partnerships with other general practitioners and supports doctors and their families by encouraging them to stay in the Goldfields-Esperance region after completing their Fellowship qualifications,\" Mr Redman said. \"The program has already resulted in a significant reduction in presentations at the Kalgoorlie Health Campus Emergency Department and is enabling the community to have easier access to general practitioners.\" Health Minister John Day said the program was a vital collaboration between organisations committed to delivering high-quality continuous education. \"This is about providing a stable and sustainable regional medical workforce,\" Mr Day said. \"With research showing 55 per cent of our rural and remote medical professionals have obtained their qualifications overseas, helping to provide a pathway for them to work here is making a big difference in regional Western Australia. \"Seventeen international medical graduates were in the program's initial cohort, with three already achieving Fellowships.\" Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700  Health Minister's office - 6552 6200 ",

Regional Development and Lands Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government investment would have a significant and lasting impact on the traditional business, entertainment and retail centre of Broome. The project consists of improvements such as major upgrades to Carnarvon Street and Dampier Terrace, as well as feasibility and technical studies for projects including a cultural centre, the extension of Gray Street and the reconnection of Chinatown to Roebuck Bay. \"Chinatown has a rich multicultural and industrial history which presents unique opportunities for growth of the town centre through projects that will boost the economic potential for local businesses and the retail and tourism sectors,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Shire of Broome and LandCorp will deliver the Chinatown Revitalisation project in partnership with the Kimberley Development Commission, building on this vibrant precinct that highlights its continuing strong Aboriginal cultural heritage and pearling history. \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions provides substantial investment to regional communities, ensuring they continue to thrive socially and economically.\" The project will receive extra investment including $2 million from the Shire of Broome and $600,000 from the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure program, a Federal Government-funded initiative managed by Tourism Western Australia. The Minister said the funding would enable the partnership to deliver on preparatory work undertaken over the last few years, building on from the shire's Chinatown Development Strategy and the Broome Growth Plan. \"Revitalising Chinatown is important for the town's future and we will now be able to go ahead and reinvigorate the traditional heart of Broome, delivering short, medium and long-term benefits to the local economy,\" he said.

The Minister said Koorda and Bencubbin schools were paid a visit by Captain Waterwise as part of his 17-school tour of the Wheatbelt, supported by the Liberal National Government, spreading the word about saving water to students over May and June. Now in its 21st year, the Water Corporation's Waterwise Schools Program takes a long-term approach to water education and behavioural change, and complements the curriculum.

Deputy Premier and Road Safety Minister Liza Harvey said the project was funded by the Road Trauma Trust Account and would take two months to complete. \"Coalfields Highway is the major road freight and passenger link between the South Western Highway and the town of Collie, connecting Bunbury to the inland regions,\" she said. \"Upgrading the heavy vehicle bay on Coalfields Highway, four kilometres east of the intersection with South Western Highway, will significantly improve safety for all road users.\" Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the upgrade to the bay would extend its life and increase capacity to accommodate the growing number of trucks travelling on Coalfields Highway. \"The heavy vehicle bay is an essential stopping area for truck drivers to carry out safety checks of their loads, brakes and tyres before continuing down the Coalfields Hill,\" Mr Nalder said. \"Once upgraded, the new bay will ultimately be able to cater for a further seven road trains, bringing the total capacity to 12 at any one time. \"The upgrade is part of a Government $48 million commitment to improve the Coalfields Highway from west of the Wellington Dam turn-off to just west of the town of Collie.\" Mrs Harvey said a record $146 million had been allocated from the Road Trauma Trust Account in 2016-17, which was made up of speed and red light camera fines.

Regional Development and Lands Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government investment would have a significant and lasting impact on the traditional business, entertainment and retail centre of Broome. The project consists of improvements such as major upgrades to Carnarvon Street and Dampier Terrace, as well as feasibility and technical studies for projects including a cultural centre, the extension of Gray Street and the reconnection of Chinatown to Roebuck Bay. \"Chinatown has a rich multicultural and industrial history which presents unique opportunities for growth of the town centre through projects that will boost the economic potential for local businesses and the retail and tourism sectors,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Shire of Broome and LandCorp will deliver the Chinatown Revitalisation project in partnership with the Kimberley Development Commission, building on this vibrant precinct that highlights its continuing strong Aboriginal cultural heritage and pearling history. \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions provides substantial investment to regional communities, ensuring they continue to thrive socially and economically.\" The project will receive extra investment including $2 million from the Shire of Broome and $600,000 from the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure program, a Federal Government-funded initiative managed by Tourism Western Australia. The Minister said the funding would enable the partnership to deliver on preparatory work undertaken over the last few years, building on from the shire's Chinatown Development Strategy and the Broome Growth Plan. \"Revitalising Chinatown is important for the town's future and we will now be able to go ahead and reinvigorate the traditional heart of Broome, delivering short, medium and long-term benefits to the local economy,\" he said.

Planning Minister Donna Faragher said the Government had allocated $9.7 million in the 2016-17 State Budget for new and significant planned works in the Midland Railway Workshops precinct, including the creation of a large public space at Railway Square. \"For more than 90 years, the Midland Railway Workshops were the centre of social and community life for generations of railway workers and local people living in this area,\" Mrs Faragher said. \"The Government has a clear plan to restore and refresh Midland's rich history of industry, innovation and strong sense of community. \"We are creating a dynamic urban village, a place where people can live, work and invest and an important commercial, residential and recreational activity centre for the eastern metropolitan region.\" The Railway Square site, within the Midland Railway Workshops precinct, will be almost twice the size of the Forrest Chase public open space in Perth's city.  It will include alfresco dining and casual seating, water features and public art, and heritage elements recognising the historic usage of the former railway shunting yard site including a 'ceremonial' railway line. Tenders for construction of the 0.74ha site are expected to be released in July, with work due to start in September 2016. \"The majority of works at Railway Square will be completed in 2017 and will create a much improved atmosphere for visitors to the annual Anzac Day event.\" The Minister said plans for a new Curtin University medical school and other health facilities in the area - including PlusLife laboratory and the new $360 million St John of God Midland Public Hospital - were driving demand for new housing and private investment in the area, which was undergoing significant change.\u00a0  Minister's office - 6552 5300  Railway Square looking west Railway Square looking east",

The grants program, overseen by the Heritage Council of Western Australia with assistance from the State Heritage Office, offers dollar-for-dollar funding for urgent conservation works or documentation to help plan future works. \"This year, the Heritage Grants Program celebrates 20 years of helping private owners of State registered places and, during this time, has funded more than 700 projects amounting to $17 million,\" Mr Jacob said. \"The Liberal National Government increased program funding by 25 per cent in 2012, recognising its importance in encouraging owners of heritage properties to invest in the preservation and enhancement of their buildings.\u00a0 This investment helps ensure the long-term viability of our State's heritage.\"  Last year's $1.273 million grants was distributed among 27 heritage projects, including 16 regional projects, generating $2.72 million in conservation works across the State. Grants included assistance to demolish a building and refurbish the Great Southern Roller Flour Mill's iconic Dingo Flour sign in North Fremantle and to restore the previously neglected Hamilton Hill landmark the Newmarket Hotel, which will become a ballet studio. \"Demand for heritage grants is consistently high, so I encourage private owners to contact the State Heritage Office,\" Mr Jacob said.  \"The office provides help to owners with their grant applications so they have the best possible chance of securing funding.\" Applications for the 2016-17 Heritage Grants Program close at 4pm on Friday, July 29, 2016.

The Premier also congratulated other individual winners including Rishelle Hume, who received the Aboriginal Award; Warwick Hemsley - Arts and Culture Award; Dr John van Bockxmeer - Community Award; Professor Arlene Chan - Professions Award; Caitlin Bassett and Nathan Fyfe as joint winners of the Sport Award; and Ashlee Harrison - Youth Award. Speaking at the event, organised by Celebrate WA, Mr Barnett said WA Day was not only about looking forward, but also recognising Aboriginal and subsequent settlement of WA and the enormous contribution migrants had made to the State. \"WA's history dates back more than 40,000 years, with the first inhabitants of the South-West being the Noongar people,\" he said. \"Recently, State Parliament passed the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Bill 2015, which formally recognises the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West.  \"It is significant that the Bill will be proclaimed on June 6, 2016, which this year will be WA Day. \"This is a historic occasion and an achievement of which the Liberal National Government is proud.\u00a0 It embodies the spirit of the WA Day holiday.\" The Premier encouraged West Australians to enjoy some of the major events being held across the State over the long weekend.\u00a0 These included a WA Day Festival at Elizabeth Quay on Monday, featuring free family activities such as WA's best burger cook-off and workshops with Western Australian sport stars. Family activities would also be held at Esplanade Park in Fremantle and at the Western Australian Museum in Albany, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\u00a0 Port Hedland and Mandurah were also hosting festivals.

        "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett today announced that the new $1.2 billion Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) would begin treating its first patients in late October 2016. \"Perth Children's Hospital will be a world-class paediatric centre with modern facilities, advanced technologies and new ways of working, which will bring enormous benefits for patients, families and staff,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We made a decision very early in our first term of Government that we would build a new children's hospital to serve the community well into the next century.\u00a0 It was always a priority over the construction of a new stadium. \"This is a direct benefit of the State's period of economic prosperity after changes in 2010 to 11 Iron Ore State Agreements held by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto allowed the Liberal National Government to allocate $350 million towards PCH. \"It is planned for the first outpatient clinics to start on October 24, followed by the start of selected day surgery from November 7, with the final patient move from Princess Margaret Hospital for Children planned for Sunday, November 20. \"This is an exciting milestone which highlights the State Government's clear commitment to improve health outcomes for our children, now and into the future. \"Although commissioning such an advanced hospital is a challenging task, the Government has delivered many new hospitals in recent years and that considerable experience is being used to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.\" Health Minister John Day said it was important to schedule key commissioning target dates. \"This ensures appropriate and accurate planning for the transition period because all equipment, systems and treatment processes must be repeatedly tested before we begin treating our young patients at the new facility,\" Mr Day said.  \"The hospital opening will be a tremendous achievement, with PCH forming the centre of a network of new and expanded facilities for children and families that we have built across the State.  \"We will not compromise safety, and the hospital will only accept patients on the planned dates if construction and commissioning activities are complete and the move can be done safely.\" The Premier said he was pleased to see the significant progress in construction which had meant commissioning and moving plans could be finalised. \"It has been a very complex project, however the result is a world-class facility all West Australians can be proud of,\" he said. \"The hospital is on track for building handover in August, however many areas such as intensive care and operating theatres are already being accessed by PCH commissioning team staff.\" Princess Margaret Hospital for Children will remain open as the State's only dedicated paediatric hospital and major trauma centre until the final patient move to PCH.

        "statement": "The Botanic Garden and Parks Authority and BHP Billiton Iron Ore have teamed up to meet the challenge of restoring landscapes in the Pilbara by publishing a new book on seeds of the arid North-West. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the book, the Pilbara Seed Atlas and Field Guide, was one of the outcomes of eight years of research through an industry partnership between the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority and BHP Billiton Iron Ore. \"This is one of the results of an important partnership with industry to help deliver better environmental outcomes in the Pilbara,\" Mr Jacob said.  \"The Pilbara Seed Atlas and Field Guide is the first of its kind to translate complex science into a practical tool to help miners, pastoralists and conservation managers to rehabilitate their land. \"I am impressed with the practicality of the book and how easy it is for people without scientific backgrounds to identify local plant species.  \"The book encourages the reader to look at the cumulative effects of mining and other activity on the region to restore landscapes as a whole, rather than restoring each site in isolation. \"The efficient and cost-effective solutions presented in this book are essential if we are to successfully restore the diversity of plants and animals and reconnect natural areas on a large scale.\" The book includes an identification guide for more than 100 common plant species, and how to collect, clean, store and germinate their seeds. The publication is one part of the Restoration Seedbank Initiative, a $5 million research partnership between the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, BHP Billiton Iron Ore and The University of Western Australia. The initiative focuses on achieving better results in seed storage and expanding Kings Park's seed research capacity to improve the ability to germinate and grow seeds for restoration. The research is developing new technologies, including coating seeds in polymer or clay-based mixes to aid germination and survival in a process called seed pelleting.\u00a0 This is helping to improve the industry average of just five per cent survival rate for seeds used in restoration.

This investment builds on the Liberal National Government's recent investment into Bunbury's waterfront of $24.9 million to revitalise Koombana Bay and redevelop Dolphin Discovery Centre. Premier Colin Barnett said the second stage would deliver infrastructure essential to meet the current and future demands of the new marina and establish a foundation for future stages. \"The investment will continue the transformation of Bunbury's waterfront, enhancing and integrating two key locations: Casuarina Drive, including BP Beach and the foreshore, and Jetty Road causeway,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Improving the city's shorelines for community use and providing the necessary infrastructure will increase visitation and stimulate growth of the local marine and tourism industries.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the investment would deliver improved access and pathways throughout the waterfront, with additional amenities including a boardwalk and plaza as well as addressing issues with coastal erosion. \"Casuarina harbour and BP Beach are popular areas, but lacking in appropriate amenities,\" Mr Redman said. \"The establishment of critical infrastructure and amenities is the catalyst for the future development of the waterfront and an important part of the vision for Bunbury.\" Mr Redman said maximising the potential of the area and creating a vibrant community space would develop the waterfront into a significant tourism asset for the State, further boosting the tourism profile and economic growth of Bunbury and the region. Bunbury is also part of the Regional Centres Development Plan, a key policy initiative, which aims to co-ordinate local decision making and support economic development to drive regional growth across Western Australia.

Visiting the Dogs' Refuge Home in Shenton Park, Local Government Minister Tony Simpson today confirmed an extra $800,000 over four years for companion animal shelters, bringing the total investment by the Liberal National Government to $1.6 million. The funding will help six organisations to rescue, care and shelter abandoned pets and promote responsible pet ownership. \"Animal Shelters in WA provide a tremendous community service, reducing the threat to native wildlife from strays and providing a stable adoption environment for pets,\" Mr Simpson said.  \"Shelters such as the Dogs' Refuge Home provide a caring environment for animals that may have been abused or neglected, ensuring they are micro-chipped, sterilised and vaccinated. \"The Government is committed to encouraging responsible pet ownership and the Companion Animal Shelters grants program supports the legislation introduced by this Government to reduce the burden of WA's stray pets.\" Since its introduction in 2012-13, the program has resulted in more than 14,000 domestic pets being rescued, 11,600 being rehomed and 11,600 being sterilised.  Treasurer Mike Nahan said the funding would help ease the financial burden on animal shelters.  \"This is another example of the Government's support for some of the fantastic work being undertaken by community sector organisations in WA,\" Dr Nahan said.

Lands Minister Terry Redman today announced the final drafting of legislation to deliver land tenure reform to the State's Rangelands, following months of consultation and feedback. Changes to the proposed legislation as a direct result of feedback includes creating a new role of industry advocate and an industry review panel to provide the Minister for Lands with independent advice on land condition issues relating to individual leases.\u00a0  \"The new model gives lessees access to the type of representation they have not had before - the industry advocate will be available to lessees and may be able to provide advice that stops an emerging land condition issue from becoming too serious,\" Mr Redman said.  \"If the Minister is faced with making an adverse decision, a panel of three people chosen by industry will provide their advice, which the Government must take into account.\u00a0 The State Government is listening to Rangelands stakeholders so we can deliver a draft Bill into State Parliament that addresses their concerns and needs for the future.\" The Minister said a new type of land tenure, known as a Rangelands lease, would form part of the legislation, and would be an option for pastoralists wishing to diversify their property.\u00a0 The legislation also included a proposed statutory right of renewal for compliant pastoral leases and the ability to transfer permits with a pastoral lease.\u00a0\u00a0  \"The proposed draft Land Administration Amendment Bill 2016 is designed to help improve security of tenure for pastoral lessees, increase the value of pastoral leases, allow for more diverse land uses and unlock the potential of the Rangelands,\" he said. More than 320 people attended stakeholder forums as part of the Rangelands public consultation in Perth, Carnarvon, Broome, Fitzroy Crossing, Halls Creek, Mount Magnet, Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Port Hedland in April 2016.\u00a0 In addition, more than 30 people attended an Aboriginal consultation forum in Derby organised with the help of the Winun Ngari Aboriginal Corporation. It is expected the draft Bill will be introduced into State Parliament next month. Minister's office - 6552 6700 ",

The Minister said the objective of the subsidised air route was to provide greater access for residents in Halls Creek and surrounding communities to services available in the larger centre of Kununurra. \"Halls Creek residents and surrounding communities will now be eligible for subsidised fares when booking tickets.\u00a0 Non-residents are welcome to use the service, however they will receive a lower subsidy compared with Halls Creek residents,\" he said.

Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the service would be trialled for an initial 12 months, with an option for a 12 month extension depending on passenger demand. \"The RPT air service, to be operated by local provider Aviair, will fly three days a week return from Kununurra to Halls Creek, providing Halls Creek residents and surrounding communities with regular access to air transport services,\" Mr Nalder said. \"After consulting with various communities in the Kimberley regarding the current Kimberley Subsidised Air Service (KSAS), we found the majority of users were travelling from Halls Creek, with limited numbers travelling from Fitzroy Crossing to Broome and Derby to Broome.\" The trial service will replace the current KSAS, which operates on the Broome-Derby-Fitzroy Crossing-Halls Creek route.  The Minister said the objective of the subsidised air route was to provide greater access for residents in Halls Creek and surrounding communities to services available in the larger centre of Kununurra. \"Halls Creek residents and surrounding communities will now be eligible for subsidised fares when booking tickets.\u00a0 Non-residents are welcome to use the service, however they will receive a lower subsidy compared with Halls Creek residents,\" he said. Services on the current Broome-Derby-Fitzroy Crossing-Halls Creek route will cease operating on June 30, 2016 and will be replaced with the Kununurra to Halls Creek (and return) route.

The history of the Guildford has been woven into the restored hotel with original tiles, fireplaces, doors and windows retained.\u00a0 Giant jarrah roof beams and charred convict-made bricks have become features of the refurbished hotel. \"I congratulate the owner and the Publican Group for taking on the conservation and refurbishment of Guildford Hotel, sensitively adapting and returning this heritage asset to the community,\" Mr Jacob said.

This investment builds on the Liberal National Government's recent investment into Bunbury's waterfront of $24.9 million to revitalise Koombana Bay and redevelop Dolphin Discovery Centre. Premier Colin Barnett said the second stage would deliver infrastructure essential to meet the current and future demands of the new marina and establish a foundation for future stages. \"The investment will continue the transformation of Bunbury's waterfront, enhancing and integrating two key locations: Casuarina Drive, including BP Beach and the foreshore, and Jetty Road causeway,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Improving the city's shorelines for community use and providing the necessary infrastructure will increase visitation and stimulate growth of the local marine and tourism industries.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the investment would deliver improved access and pathways throughout the waterfront, with additional amenities including a boardwalk and plaza as well as addressing issues with coastal erosion. \"Casuarina harbour and BP Beach are popular areas, but lacking in appropriate amenities,\" Mr Redman said. \"The establishment of critical infrastructure and amenities is the catalyst for the future development of the waterfront and an important part of the vision for Bunbury.\" Mr Redman said maximising the potential of the area and creating a vibrant community space would develop the waterfront into a significant tourism asset for the State, further boosting the tourism profile and economic growth of Bunbury and the region. Bunbury is also part of the Regional Centres Development Plan, a key policy initiative, which aims to co-ordinate local decision making and support economic development to drive regional growth across Western Australia.

Lands Minister Terry Redman today announced the final drafting of legislation to deliver land tenure reform to the State's Rangelands, following months of consultation and feedback. Changes to the proposed legislation as a direct result of feedback includes creating a new role of industry advocate and an industry review panel to provide the Minister for Lands with independent advice on land condition issues relating to individual leases.\u00a0  \"The new model gives lessees access to the type of representation they have not had before - the industry advocate will be available to lessees and may be able to provide advice that stops an emerging land condition issue from becoming too serious,\" Mr Redman said.  \"If the Minister is faced with making an adverse decision, a panel of three people chosen by industry will provide their advice, which the Government must take into account.\u00a0 The State Government is listening to Rangelands stakeholders so we can deliver a draft Bill into State Parliament that addresses their concerns and needs for the future.\" The Minister said a new type of land tenure, known as a Rangelands lease, would form part of the legislation, and would be an option for pastoralists wishing to diversify their property.\u00a0 The legislation also included a proposed statutory right of renewal for compliant pastoral leases and the ability to transfer permits with a pastoral lease.\u00a0\u00a0  \"The proposed draft Land Administration Amendment Bill 2016 is designed to help improve security of tenure for pastoral lessees, increase the value of pastoral leases, allow for more diverse land uses and unlock the potential of the Rangelands,\" he said. More than 320 people attended stakeholder forums as part of the Rangelands public consultation in Perth, Carnarvon, Broome, Fitzroy Crossing, Halls Creek, Mount Magnet, Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Port Hedland in April 2016.\u00a0 In addition, more than 30 people attended an Aboriginal consultation forum in Derby organised with the help of the Winun Ngari Aboriginal Corporation. It is expected the draft Bill will be introduced into State Parliament next month. Minister's office - 6552 6700 ",

Releasing the whole-of-government Digital WA strategy today, Innovation Minister Bill Marmion said it was a practical vision to give West Australians easier access to quality services, whenever and wherever it was convenient for them. \"Imagine having secure and relevant State Government services available through a single web portal anywhere, anytime and on any device - your computer, mobile phone or tablet - without the need to attend or call a Government office,\" Mr Marmion said. \"From simply paying bills online to obtaining the latest information and data on everything Government that matters to you, that is the Digital WA promise once fully implemented. \"Digital WA will also help entrepreneurs and start-up companies flourish, as they use Government open data sources to produce new products and services to meet the evolving needs of the community.\" The Minister said the Digital WA strategy would guide those changes over the next four years. \"Our ICT bywords are innovation, collaboration and transformation and work has already started to ensure the success of the strategy,\" he said \"In November last year, I launched the GovNext-ICT initiative which will improve how Government agencies pay for, and use, technology across the public sector. \"GovNext-ICT helps agencies to migrate into the cloud, reduces the cost of running and maintaining systems, and connects all agencies into a single Government-wide network, enabling synergies to be realised that were previously impossible.\" Mr Marmion said Digital WA aimed to curb growth in the State Government's current $1 to $2 billion annual ICT spend. \"The targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the strategy are ambitious, but reflect the Government's strong commitment to delivering enhanced digital services to West Australians,\" he said.  \"One of these KPIs is to have 75 per cent of all Government-related transactions completed online by the public by 2020.\" With the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer leading the collaboration across the State's more than 100 agencies, the shift to common platforms and the leveraging of cloud services will enable agencies to be more agile and responsive to the changing needs of the community.\u00a0  The Minister said the public was increasingly comfortable with online information and transactions. \"The Digital WA strategy will accelerate the pace of digital transformation across the public sector, which will ultimately benefit all West Australians in accessing and using Government services,\" he said.

Energy Minister Mike Nahan said the last of the five systems, which belonged to Cape Le Grand farmers John and Val Locke who lost powerlines and poles on their property in the November 2015 bushfires, had now been installed. Dr Nahan said four customers across five properties had taken up the opportunity to partner with Horizon Power in the WA-first project after more than 320 power poles and hundreds of kilometres of powerlines were destroyed in the bushfires.  \"I commend Horizon Power for identifying that we could offer these customers a solar-powered, stand-alone power system, which incorporates battery technology and is not connected to the grid,\" he said. \"This is a WA-first project offering an innovative solution for customers instead of rebuilding this part of the network, which is more susceptible to adverse weather and other causes of power interruptions.  \"These customers - including the Lockes - are pioneers of these new systems, which will be owned and operated by Horizon Power.\u00a0 The customers will pay the same cost for their electricity supplied by these units as they did previously for power supplied by poles and wires.  \"While the units won't be connected to the network, customers will receive the same service, including being able to call and rely on Horizon Power to respond to any unplanned power interruptions.\"  The Minister said Horizon Power was working to identify other potential sites where stand-alone power systems could be a viable alternative to connecting to, or maintaining or replacing, the overhead network across its service area.

Mr L'Estrange said an information sheet about the former Pro-Force gold processing site outlined three stages of the project which would be carried out under the Abandoned Mine Lands Program using the Mining Rehabilitation Fund. \"The objective of the work is to improve community safety risks associated with the site which is adjacent to the Gorge, a public area water reserve located two kilometres east of the town,\" he said.  \"For some time, concerns have been raised by the community about antisocial behaviour and illegal dumping at this derelict plant, as well as the safety aspects of an unsealed vertical shaft and the five-metre deep excavated trench adjacent to the Coolgardie-Esperance Highway.\" Stage 1 of the work will include a detailed site assessment to identify the degree of the safety and environmental concerns.  During this stage, in collaboration with the Shire of Coolgardie, local people will have the opportunity to contribute to the proposed plans and longer-term solutions through a consultation process.  Stage 2 involves making this site safe and is expected to be completed by December 2016. \"This is a positive start to removing what has been a long-term blight on the entrance to the town of Coolgardie.\u00a0 It is a real win-win for the community, the Shire of Coolgardie and the State Government,\" the Minister said.

A film festival for Exmouth, Speedway Sedans in Albany, the Karijini experience and the City to Surf's regional series are some of the events to benefit from funding through the initiative, co-ordinated by Tourism WA and made possible by the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett said the Regional Events Scheme provided vital support to kick-start and develop events which involved local communities and attracted visitors and media coverage. \"The record funding pool of up to $850,000 in 2016-17 has meant 12 events received sponsorship through the scheme for the first time, while more established events have the chance to grow bigger and better,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Including the latest recipients, the scheme has supported more than 300 regional events since 2011, helping to shape WA as an exciting destination with year-round activities to provide an extra drawcard for visitors.  \"Tourism is a major contributor to regional economies.\u00a0 In 2015, visitors spent $9 billion in the State, including $4 billion in regional areas.\u00a0 We want to see this regional contribution grow to $4.75 billion by 2020, and events are key to that goal.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment played a crucial role in positioning regional WA as a recognised tourism destination.  \"Regional events generate jobs and business opportunities for local communities, and deliver significant social and economic benefits to the regions,\" Mr Redman said. \"Strong regional communities bring prosperity to WA and I am pleased to see Royalties for Regions invest in the sustainability of our regions.\"  The 12 events receiving funding for the first time through the 2016-17 Regional Events Scheme are Ningalens Film Competition (Exmouth), Discovery Bay Trail Run (Albany), Speedway Sedans Australia National Super Sedan Championships (Albany), Qantas Wine Show of Western Australia (Mount Barker), AFL Masters WA Broome Carnival, Blues for the Bush and Community Open Day (Perenjori), King of the Cut (Mandurah), Karijini Experience (Karijini), City to Surf for Activ Regional Series (Karratha, Geraldton, Albany and Busselton), LiveLighter Harvey Harvest Festival (Harvey), Emergence Creative Festival (Margaret River) and X-Adventure Dunsborough (Dunsborough). The scheme will also continue to support popular events such as the Kickstarters Gascoyne Dash, Blues at Bridgetown, Northam Motor Sport Festival, the WA PGA Championship in the Goldfields, Karratha's Red Earth Arts Festival and the Wildflower Show and Spring Festival in Ravensthorpe.

        "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett has officially opened the new Mills Park Community Centre in the City of Gosnells, made possible by $8 million in State Government grants. The community centre is part of the Mills Park redevelopment, a district hub catering to community, sport and recreation activities with specialist facilities to accommodate local groups.  Mr Barnett said the infrastructure project was the largest the city had ever undertaken and would increase social, leisure and recreational opportunities for the local community, while preserving the park's natural assets. \"I congratulate the City of Gosnells for developing an outstanding community hub which brings state-of-the-art recreation, community and sporting facilities to the area,\" he said. \"The Mills Park redevelopment received $4 million in funding through a Lotterywest grant, and a further $4 million through the Department of Sport and Recreation.\" At the heart of Mills Park is the community centre. The building is Western Australia's first 6-Star Green Star public building and includes a community hall, function centre, meeting rooms, multi-purpose activity spaces, club rooms, cafe, change rooms, public amenities and a kindy gym.  \"This outstanding building demonstrates not only a commitment to bringing a growing community together, but also to sustainable building practices,\" the Premier said. Sport and Recreation Minister Mia Davies said the city received a grant of $2 million from the Community Sporting and Recreation Facilities Fund in 2014-15 and an extra $2 million in the 2015-16 forward planning round.  \"This money is going towards a wide range of sporting facilities at Mills Park including tennis courts, two reconfigured playing fields, floodlighting, cricket nets, two multi-purpose synthetic soccer fields, a skate park and change rooms, plus a contribution to the sporting clubrooms in the Mills Park Community Centre,\" Ms Davies said. Along with the community centre, the Mills Park redevelopment also includes a skate plaza, nature play space, piazza, sporting infrastructure and walkways.\u00a0 The piazza, which features a stage area and viewing space, will be a venue for events and festivals in the city.  The fully accessible nature play space is five times larger than was available previously and connects to a network of well-lit walkways to provide further opportunities for the community to connect with the natural environment.  The site also includes the State's first full-size artificial soccer pitches which are home to two local clubs. Mr Barnett acknowledged the hard work of the City of Gosnells in working collaboratively with residents to develop a recreation space that would provide for a connected community.  \"Extensive consultation will ensure these facilities meet the needs of the city and will be enjoyed by the local community for many years to come,\" he said. The Mills Park Master Plan was finalised in December 2014, with construction beginning in April 2015.\u00a0 Stage 2 began in November 2015 with an expected completion date of February 2017, four months ahead of schedule.  The total cost of the redevelopment is $47 million with Lotterywest and the Department of Sport and Recreation each providing $4 million and the City of Gosnells contributing the balance.

        "statement": "The design of the new Pingelly Health Centre has been unveiled as part of the State Government's $500 million Southern Inland Health Initiative funded by Royalties for Regions. Health Minister John Day said the innovative new Pingelly Health Centre would provide enhanced primary and community care facilities, including 24/7 emergency care. \"The primary health centre at Pingelly will bring together healthcare providers focused on the promotion of good health, the prevention and early detection of illness and the management of chronic disease to help people stay well and out of hospitals,\" Mr Day said. The facility will include an emergency department with ambulance bays and Emergency Telehealth Service videoconferencing facilities.\u00a0 There will also be four multi-purpose consulting rooms enabled with telehealth and group therapy rooms to deliver a range of health services including physiotherapy, occupational speech therapy, child health, mental health and community-based aged-care services.\u00a0  The centre will also have general practice consultation rooms and treatment spaces allowing for co-ordinated patient care between the local GP and other health professionals. The designs by Oldfield Knott Architects for the new Pingelly Health Centre are a result of extensive planning by WA Country Health Service Wheatbelt staff and local community members.\u00a0\u00a0 A local project user group was established to drive community input into the design of the facility and the services to be provided. \"The result is a visionary design, including pavilion-style pitched roofs and Salmon Gum coloured face bricks.\u00a0 The 25kW solar panels that have been incorporated onto the roof will save around $10,000 per year in electricity costs,\" Mr Day said. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said investment in health infrastructure was fundamental to the ongoing growth of regional Western Australia. \"The new, purpose-built facility will support a contemporary health service and bring improvements in patient care,\" Mr Redman said.  \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions is enhancing the delivery of sustainable services that meet the current and future healthcare demands of our regional communities.\"  Construction is scheduled to start in the third quarter of 2016 and be completed by early 2018.

Mr L'Estrange said the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) had issued more than 17,000 Miner's Rights prospecting   in Western Australia in the past five years. \"The issuing of more than 17,000 permits shows the growing popularity of gold prospecting in the State, however safety should always be a prospector's number one priority,\" he said.  \"WA's outback can be a harsh, remote environment, which is why personal safety is such an important consideration when prospecting.\" Mr L'Estrange urged all prospectors to carry Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) when in remote areas. \"PLBs are the best way of avoiding what can be a tragic outcome of getting lost in the Goldfields and the outback.\u00a0 If you're not carrying a beacon, you're not taking enough responsibility for your life,\" he said.  \"Four years ago, a month-long search ended in tragedy and sparked the push for PLBs.\u00a0 In contrast, a search conducted last year found the missing person just four hours after his device began sending out signals.\" The device, which can be purchased from most outdoor stores, is ideal for use in remote areas as it does not rely on telecommunication networks to submit a signal. Deputy Premier and Police Minister Liza Harvey said of the land searches conducted in WA in 2015, there were six for missing prospectors.  \"The land searches included four in the Goldfields-Esperance District and two in the Mid West-Gascoyne District,\" Mrs Harvey said.\u00a0  \"We have had tragic outcomes in the past after people have become lost.\u00a0 The choice to carry a beacon should be an easy one for prospectors.\" The Seven Golden Rules for prospecting are: Mines and Petroleum Minister's office - 6552 6900 Deputy Premier and Police Minister's office - 6552 5900",

The Premier also congratulated other individual winners including Rishelle Hume, who received the Aboriginal Award; Warwick Hemsley - Arts and Culture Award; Dr John van Bockxmeer - Community Award; Professor Arlene Chan - Professions Award; Caitlin Bassett and Nathan Fyfe as joint winners of the Sport Award; and Ashlee Harrison - Youth Award. Speaking at the event, organised by Celebrate WA, Mr Barnett said WA Day was not only about looking forward, but also recognising Aboriginal and subsequent settlement of WA and the enormous contribution migrants had made to the State. \"WA's history dates back more than 40,000 years, with the first inhabitants of the South-West being the Noongar people,\" he said. \"Recently, State Parliament passed the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Bill 2015, which formally recognises the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West.  \"It is significant that the Bill will be proclaimed on June 6, 2016, which this year will be WA Day. \"This is a historic occasion and an achievement of which the Liberal National Government is proud.\u00a0 It embodies the spirit of the WA Day holiday.\" The Premier encouraged West Australians to enjoy some of the major events being held across the State over the long weekend.\u00a0 These included a WA Day Festival at Elizabeth Quay on Monday, featuring free family activities such as WA's best burger cook-off and workshops with Western Australian sport stars.

The campground, to be built by the Department of Parks and Wildlife, is being developed through the Liberal National Government's $21.05 million Royalties for Regions Parks for People Caravan and Camping initiative, which is part of the Western Australian Caravan and Camping Action Plan 2013-2018.  \"This exciting campground development will deliver 45 individual camp sites and two group camping areas in a jarrah, marri and peppermint forest setting,\" he said.  \"There is a need for more high-quality camping experiences in the Margaret River region and, in particular, Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park.\u00a0 At peak times, the recently expanded Contos campground is full so it's important to meet the demand with more high-quality camping sites.\" Mr Jacob said the new campground would be built on Jarrahdene Road adjacent to the remains of the old Jarrahdene mill, built in 1896. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said Royalties for Regions investment in the Parks for People Initiative was helping West Australians and visitors experience affordable caravan and camping holidays. \"Providing essential infrastructure at campgrounds in our regional national parks creates greater recreational opportunities and encourages more people to get out and experience regional WA,\" Mr Redman said.  \"I look forward to seeing more people exploring our regions through affordable caravan and camping holidays.\" The Jarrahdene campground is expected to be completed by mid-2017.\u00a0 It will be managed under a Community Partnership model in which a private or community sector partner organisation is contracted by Parks and Wildlife to undertake the day-to-day management of the campground on a fee-for-service basis.

Deputy Premier and Training and Workforce Development Minister Liza Harvey said the hub would be a contemporary, high-quality learning support facility to meet the needs of students throughout the Mid-West region. Mrs Harvey said $1.8 million was allocated in the 2016-17 State Budget to complete the funding commitment for the $2.7 million project.\u00a0 A total of $2 million of this was from the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. \"The hub is part of a wider campus strategy to promote shared learning experiences, socialisation and positive engagement of students and staff in campus life,\" she said. \"The hub will be a 'one-stop-shop' for student advisory and support services, course and careers information, and library and learning resource services.\u00a0 It will provide a connection between formal learning undertaken in classrooms and the informal, self-directed learning which is increasingly sought by students.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the contemporary learning environment would support innovative and flexible training delivery to encourage greater student participation.  \"This Royalties for Regions investment will contribute towards a vibrant and engaged workforce that can capitalise on the projected growth in regional employment,\" Mr Redman said.  \"Royalties for Regions is building regional Western Australia's economic sustainability and I look forward to seeing the benefits in our regional communities.\" Deputy Premier and Training and Workforce Development Minister's office - 6552 5900 Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700",

Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the recovery of the woylie, a small marsupial, was a part of the Liberal National Government's Western Shield wildlife conservation program, which was working to reduce the threat of foxes and feral cats on native animals. About half the woylies have been taken to Australian Wildlife Conservancy's (AWC) wildlife sanctuaries at Mount Gibson, 350km north of Perth, and Karakamia at Chidlow, about 50km north-east of Perth.\u00a0 The remaining woylies have been transported to Dryandra Woodland, near Narrogin in the Wheatbelt region. The woylies moved to AWC properties have been released in feral predator-free sanctuaries to supplement animals that were moved to these sites in 2015, while the animals moved to Dryandra have added to the wild population there and increased the genetic diversity of this important population. \"The Perup Sanctuary supports the most genetically diverse woylie population in the State and this transfer of the marsupials is part of conservation efforts focused on establishing insurance populations across a range of locations,\" Mr Jacob said. The woylie population is estimated to be less than 20,000 in Australia, including 400 to 600 of the marsupials in the Perup Sanctuary, with the only wild populations remaining in Dryandra and the Upper Warren in the State's south-west.  The Minister said genetic diversity of woylies at Perup and in the wild made them the most important in Australia. \"These wild populations remain vulnerable to predation by foxes and cats and potential disease outbreaks,\" he said. \"The partnership between Parks and Wildlife and AWC enables us to increase our capacity to conserve wildlife while also, and most importantly, increasing the number of populations of a critically endangered species.\" Minister's office - 6552 5800",

This investment builds on the Liberal National Government's recent investment into Bunbury's waterfront of $24.9 million to revitalise Koombana Bay and redevelop Dolphin Discovery Centre. Premier Colin Barnett said the second stage would deliver infrastructure essential to meet the current and future demands of the new marina and establish a foundation for future stages. \"The investment will continue the transformation of Bunbury's waterfront, enhancing and integrating two key locations: Casuarina Drive, including BP Beach and the foreshore, and Jetty Road causeway,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Improving the city's shorelines for community use and providing the necessary infrastructure will increase visitation and stimulate growth of the local marine and tourism industries.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the investment would deliver improved access and pathways throughout the waterfront, with additional amenities including a boardwalk and plaza as well as addressing issues with coastal erosion. \"Casuarina harbour and BP Beach are popular areas, but lacking in appropriate amenities,\" Mr Redman said. \"The establishment of critical infrastructure and amenities is the catalyst for the future development of the waterfront and an important part of the vision for Bunbury.\" Mr Redman said maximising the potential of the area and creating a vibrant community space would develop the waterfront into a significant tourism asset for the State, further boosting the tourism profile and economic growth of Bunbury and the region. Bunbury is also part of the Regional Centres Development Plan, a key policy initiative, which aims to co-ordinate local decision making and support economic development to drive regional growth across Western Australia.

        "statement": "The Liberal National Government has again signalled its commitment to road safety by allocating $1.37 million to upgrade a heavy vehicle bay on Coalfields Highway. Deputy Premier and Road Safety Minister Liza Harvey said the project was funded by the Road Trauma Trust Account and would take two months to complete. \"Coalfields Highway is the major road freight and passenger link between the South Western Highway and the town of Collie, connecting Bunbury to the inland regions,\" she said. \"Upgrading the heavy vehicle bay on Coalfields Highway, four kilometres east of the intersection with South Western Highway, will significantly improve safety for all road users.\" Transport Minister Dean Nalder said the upgrade to the bay would extend its life and increase capacity to accommodate the growing number of trucks travelling on Coalfields Highway. \"The heavy vehicle bay is an essential stopping area for truck drivers to carry out safety checks of their loads, brakes and tyres before continuing down the Coalfields Hill,\" Mr Nalder said. \"Once upgraded, the new bay will ultimately be able to cater for a further seven road trains, bringing the total capacity to 12 at any one time. \"The upgrade is part of a Government $48 million commitment to improve the Coalfields Highway from west of the Wellington Dam turn-off to just west of the town of Collie.\" Mrs Harvey said a record $146 million had been allocated from the Road Trauma Trust Account in 2016-17, which was made up of speed and red light camera fines.

        "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett today announced that the new $1.2 billion Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) would begin treating its first patients in late October 2016. \"Perth Children's Hospital will be a world-class paediatric centre with modern facilities, advanced technologies and new ways of working, which will bring enormous benefits for patients, families and staff,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We made a decision very early in our first term of Government that we would build a new children's hospital to serve the community well into the next century.\u00a0 It was always a priority over the construction of a new stadium. \"This is a direct benefit of the State's period of economic prosperity after changes in 2010 to 11 Iron Ore State Agreements held by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto allowed the Liberal National Government to allocate $350 million towards PCH. \"It is planned for the first outpatient clinics to start on October 24, followed by the start of selected day surgery from November 7, with the final patient move from Princess Margaret Hospital for Children planned for Sunday, November 20. \"This is an exciting milestone which highlights the State Government's clear commitment to improve health outcomes for our children, now and into the future. \"Although commissioning such an advanced hospital is a challenging task, the Government has delivered many new hospitals in recent years and that considerable experience is being used to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.\" Health Minister John Day said it was important to schedule key commissioning target dates. \"This ensures appropriate and accurate planning for the transition period because all equipment, systems and treatment processes must be repeatedly tested before we begin treating our young patients at the new facility,\" Mr Day said.  \"The hospital opening will be a tremendous achievement, with PCH forming the centre of a network of new and expanded facilities for children and families that we have built across the State.  \"We will not compromise safety, and the hospital will only accept patients on the planned dates if construction and commissioning activities are complete and the move can be done safely.\" The Premier said he was pleased to see the significant progress in construction which had meant commissioning and moving plans could be finalised. \"It has been a very complex project, however the result is a world-class facility all West Australians can be proud of,\" he said. \"The hospital is on track for building handover in August, however many areas such as intensive care and operating theatres are already being accessed by PCH commissioning team staff.\" Princess Margaret Hospital for Children will remain open as the State's only dedicated paediatric hospital and major trauma centre until the final patient move to PCH.

A film festival for Exmouth, Speedway Sedans in Albany, the Karijini experience and the City to Surf's regional series are some of the events to benefit from funding through the initiative, co-ordinated by Tourism WA and made possible by the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett said the Regional Events Scheme provided vital support to kick-start and develop events which involved local communities and attracted visitors and media coverage. \"The record funding pool of up to $850,000 in 2016-17 has meant 12 events received sponsorship through the scheme for the first time, while more established events have the chance to grow bigger and better,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Including the latest recipients, the scheme has supported more than 300 regional events since 2011, helping to shape WA as an exciting destination with year-round activities to provide an extra drawcard for visitors.  \"Tourism is a major contributor to regional economies.\u00a0 In 2015, visitors spent $9 billion in the State, including $4 billion in regional areas.\u00a0 We want to see this regional contribution grow to $4.75 billion by 2020, and events are key to that goal.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment played a crucial role in positioning regional WA as a recognised tourism destination.  \"Regional events generate jobs and business opportunities for local communities, and deliver significant social and economic benefits to the regions,\" Mr Redman said. \"Strong regional communities bring prosperity to WA and I am pleased to see Royalties for Regions invest in the sustainability of our regions.\"  The 12 events receiving funding for the first time through the 2016-17 Regional Events Scheme are Ningalens Film Competition (Exmouth), Discovery Bay Trail Run (Albany), Speedway Sedans Australia National Super Sedan Championships (Albany), Qantas Wine Show of Western Australia (Mount Barker), AFL Masters WA Broome Carnival, Blues for the Bush and Community Open Day (Perenjori), King of the Cut (Mandurah), Karijini Experience (Karijini), City to Surf for Activ Regional Series (Karratha, Geraldton, Albany and Busselton), LiveLighter Harvey Harvest Festival (Harvey), Emergence Creative Festival (Margaret River) and X-Adventure Dunsborough (Dunsborough). The scheme will also continue to support popular events such as the Kickstarters Gascoyne Dash, Blues at Bridgetown, Northam Motor Sport Festival, the WA PGA Championship in the Goldfields, Karratha's Red Earth Arts Festival and the Wildflower Show and Spring Festival in Ravensthorpe.

        "statement": "The Liberal National Government has announced construction is expected to start later this year on a new interactive hub for students at Central Regional TAFE's Geraldton campus, with funding allocated in the 2016-17 State Budget. Deputy Premier and Training and Workforce Development Minister Liza Harvey said the hub would be a contemporary, high-quality learning support facility to meet the needs of students throughout the Mid-West region. Mrs Harvey said $1.8 million was allocated in the 2016-17 State Budget to complete the funding commitment for the $2.7 million project.\u00a0 A total of $2 million of this was from the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. \"The hub is part of a wider campus strategy to promote shared learning experiences, socialisation and positive engagement of students and staff in campus life,\" she said. \"The hub will be a 'one-stop-shop' for student advisory and support services, course and careers information, and library and learning resource services.\u00a0 It will provide a connection between formal learning undertaken in classrooms and the informal, self-directed learning which is increasingly sought by students.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the contemporary learning environment would support innovative and flexible training delivery to encourage greater student participation.  \"This Royalties for Regions investment will contribute towards a vibrant and engaged workforce that can capitalise on the projected growth in regional employment,\" Mr Redman said.  \"Royalties for Regions is building regional Western Australia's economic sustainability and I look forward to seeing the benefits in our regional communities.\" Deputy Premier and Training and Workforce Development Minister's office - 6552 5900 Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700",

Inspecting the advanced Nauti-Craft technology today, Innovation Minister Bill Marmion said the marine start-up company was an outstanding example of Western Australian ingenuity with global commercial applications. Nauti-Craft Pty Ltd is a research and development company focused on the design and development of hydraulic suspension system technology for multi-hulled vessels. \"Nauti-Craft was founded by Chris Heyring, who also started Kinetic Pty Ltd, another Dunsborough-based small business which invented automotive suspension systems now used by major car makers, including Toyota and Nissan,\" Mr Marmion said. \"This new company is now adapting this suspension system to the marine environment, enabling vessels to react rapidly to changing ocean conditions. \"This innovation promises widespread applications and the company already has strong links with the European renewable energy sector. The United Kingdom-based Carbon Trust is helping fund the research and development, looking towards rolling out the technology on vessels servicing the offshore wind farm industry in Europe.\" The technology has been licensed to a major vessel supplier to the European offshore wind farm market and also to a Middle Eastern luxury boat builder. \"Nauti-Craft is an example of a regional Western Australian company taking advantage of opportunities in the global market and shows us that in today's world, isolation is no barrier to commercialising innovation and supporting Western Australian jobs,\" the Minister said. \"The Liberal National Government's network of international trade and investment offices works with companies such as Nauti-Craft to help Western Australian entrepreneurs export their technology and services. \"Capitalising on this network will form an important part of the rollout of the $20 million innovation package announced in the recent State Budget.\" Minister's office - 6552 6800",

State Development Minister Bill Marmion said the Liberal National Government strongly supported the annual marathon exchange program.\u00a0 The program began in 2011, as part of celebrations for the 30th anniversary of the Sister State relationship. \"I'm delighted to welcome runners Masahiro Fujita and Mei Matsuyama to WA to take part in the Perth Marathon in the 35th year of our Sister State relationship,\" Mr Marmion said. \"WA deeply values its relationship with the Hyogo Prefecture, and with Japan more broadly. \"Every second year, we send Western Australian runners to take part in the Kobe Marathon in Japan.\u00a0 This year, it is the Hyogo Prefecture's turn to send runners to WA.\" Mr Fujita and Ms Matsuyama were selected to take part in this year's exchange based on their strong performance in last year's Kobe Marathon. \"Japan was an essential early investor in the State's resources sector, and two-way trade between WA and Japan was valued at $19 billion in 2015,\" the Minister said. \"Our cultural ties are also strong, with about 3,500 Japanese-born people living in this State at the time of the 2011 Census.\" Another program conducted each year as part of the Sister State relationship is the Banshu Fashion Textile Program, where promising young Western Australian designers travel to Hyogo to learn traditional Japanese methods of textile-making.

Health Minister John Day said forward works included demolition of the corporate services building and some accommodation blocks of the old hospital, diversion of existing services and preparation of the foundations for the new building. \"The building tender for the main build of the new Warren Health Service has now been released and the contract is due to be awarded in July 2016.\u00a0 Construction will begin soon after and the hospital is due to be completed by mid-2018,\" Mr Day said.  \"The new hospital will include a state-of-the-art emergency department, an inpatient ward, surgical services, operating theatre, medical imaging, pathology and outpatient, primary health care and other support services.\" The new build is part of the State Government's Royalties for Regions investment in the Southern Inland Health Initiative's capital infrastructure program that prioritises new builds and upgrades to 37 hospitals and health services in the Wheatbelt, South-West, Great Southern and Mid-West. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government's $500 million Southern Inland Health Initiative had been made possible by the Royalties for Regions program and was being delivered by the WA Country Health Service. \"As the Member for Warren-Blackwood, I'm pleased to see this new health facility come to fruition and for the people of Manjimup to be provided with a modern, well-equipped health facility that suit present and future needs,\" Mr Redman said. \"Royalties for Regions is transforming health care across regional Western Australia.\u00a0 Regional communities deserve access to a high level of health care and investing in health infrastructure and services can reduce the need for residents to travel to Perth for diagnosis or treatment.\" Health Minister's office - 6552 6200 Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700",

        "statement": "A vehicle pool trial providing people with disability in the Lower South West region with more transport options will continue for another year thanks to $654,425 provided by the Liberal National Government. The South West Wheels program was developed in July 2015 through a partnership between the Disability Services Commission and the not-for-profit Western Australian Motor Industry Foundation. It provides flexible, low-cost access to individualised transport to people with disability living in Manjimup, Busselton and Donnybrook and surrounding areas. Disability Services Minister Donna Faragher said people with disability who were eligible for Disability Services Commission support could access the service, which provides wheelchair accessible vans and sedans and smaller vehicles with wheelchair carriers for a small fee. Mrs Faragher said demand for the South West Wheels service continued to grow, with 380 vehicle bookings in its first 10 months of operation. \"South West Wheels provides an innovative transport service for people with disability, their families and carers living in the Lower South West region,\" she said. \"Not having access to a vehicle, particularly an appropriately equipped vehicle, can restrict a person with disability from fully participating and enjoying community life. \"The availability of these vehicles means people with disability in this area can go out and do the things many of us take for granted, like travel to the doctor or other appointments and social outings.\" From July 1, 2016, the South West Wheels fleet will include 15 vehicles, available from regional centres including Manjimup, Busselton and Donnybrook.

Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the release of Royalties for Regions funding to partner agencies was a major step forward in implementing the strategy. \"Despite water quality issues caused from a century of land use, the Vasse-Wonnerup Wetlands system retains exceptional ecological values and is an asset to this community,\" Mr Redman said.

A film festival for Exmouth, Speedway Sedans in Albany, the Karijini experience and the City to Surf's regional series are some of the events to benefit from funding through the initiative, co-ordinated by Tourism WA and made possible by the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett said the Regional Events Scheme provided vital support to kick-start and develop events which involved local communities and attracted visitors and media coverage. \"The record funding pool of up to $850,000 in 2016-17 has meant 12 events received sponsorship through the scheme for the first time, while more established events have the chance to grow bigger and better,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Including the latest recipients, the scheme has supported more than 300 regional events since 2011, helping to shape WA as an exciting destination with year-round activities to provide an extra drawcard for visitors.  \"Tourism is a major contributor to regional economies.\u00a0 In 2015, visitors spent $9 billion in the State, including $4 billion in regional areas.\u00a0 We want to see this regional contribution grow to $4.75 billion by 2020, and events are key to that goal.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment played a crucial role in positioning regional WA as a recognised tourism destination.  \"Regional events generate jobs and business opportunities for local communities, and deliver significant social and economic benefits to the regions,\" Mr Redman said. \"Strong regional communities bring prosperity to WA and I am pleased to see Royalties for Regions invest in the sustainability of our regions.\"  The 12 events receiving funding for the first time through the 2016-17 Regional Events Scheme are Ningalens Film Competition (Exmouth), Discovery Bay Trail Run (Albany), Speedway Sedans Australia National Super Sedan Championships (Albany), Qantas Wine Show of Western Australia (Mount Barker), AFL Masters WA Broome Carnival, Blues for the Bush and Community Open Day (Perenjori), King of the Cut (Mandurah), Karijini Experience (Karijini), City to Surf for Activ Regional Series (Karratha, Geraldton, Albany and Busselton), LiveLighter Harvey Harvest Festival (Harvey), Emergence Creative Festival (Margaret River) and X-Adventure Dunsborough (Dunsborough). The scheme will also continue to support popular events such as the Kickstarters Gascoyne Dash, Blues at Bridgetown, Northam Motor Sport Festival, the WA PGA Championship in the Goldfields, Karratha's Red Earth Arts Festival and the Wildflower Show and Spring Festival in Ravensthorpe.

The funding will cover upgrades to the skate park and includes a new adventure play area, nature play zone, landscaping, seating and youth art, to create a centralised hub for active participation. Mr Barnett said the youth precinct was a popular destination for young people and the shire had identified the need for the facilities to be upgraded in response to demand for youth activities. \"The redevelopment will cater for a wide range of participants from a new dual use pathway for beginner skaters and riders, to an advanced skate and ride section that takes users to the next skill level,\" he said. \"There will also be planned spectator seating, with shade shelters to ensure all members of the community can be a part of the action and be comfortable during the heat of the day.\" The planning and design of the redevelopment has involved young people from the local community, with multiple options explored for the skate facility.  \"It is great to see young members of the community working together to identify the needs of their peers for this centralised community hub,\" the Premier said. The planning of the redevelopment will complement the upgrade of the youth zone room, located adjacent to the skate park.  The redeveloped youth precinct is due to be completed by September 2017.

Water Minister Mia Davies said DairyCare was a partnership between Western Dairy, State agencies, Natural Resource Management groups and dairy farmers that built on more than 10 years of experience and partnerships in the South-West. \"As a result of this Royalties for Regions funding, we estimate at least 30 priority dairy effluent systems will be upgraded and 80 nutrient use plans will be developed under the national Fert$mart program, with the result being a substantial reduction of nutrients entering waterways,\" Ms Davies said. \"The partnership includes the establishment of an industry reference group, which will develop a strong self-regulatory approach and ensure farmers were motivated to be involved.\" Agriculture and Food Minister Dean Nalder said DairyCare came at an important time for farmers and could lead to important cost savings for the industry. \"By retaining nutrients on farm and reducing the negative contribution they make to waterways through run-off into local rivers and streams, farmers have an opportunity to save money and meet community expectations for the environment,\" Mr Nalder said. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment in DairyCare was an important step to protect and support waterways and regional estuaries by helping a valued industry to become more sustainable.  \"DairyCare will investigate innovative options for improving dairy effluent management and provide farmers with information, incentives and the tools to make better decisions about fertiliser use and effluent management,\" Mr Redman said.

Water Minister Mia Davies said DairyCare was a partnership between Western Dairy, State agencies, Natural Resource Management groups and dairy farmers that built on more than 10 years of experience and partnerships in the South-West. \"As a result of this Royalties for Regions funding, we estimate at least 30 priority dairy effluent systems will be upgraded and 80 nutrient use plans will be developed under the national Fert$mart program, with the result being a substantial reduction of nutrients entering waterways,\" Ms Davies said. \"The partnership includes the establishment of an industry reference group, which will develop a strong self-regulatory approach and ensure farmers were motivated to be involved.\" Agriculture and Food Minister Dean Nalder said DairyCare came at an important time for farmers and could lead to important cost savings for the industry. \"By retaining nutrients on farm and reducing the negative contribution they make to waterways through run-off into local rivers and streams, farmers have an opportunity to save money and meet community expectations for the environment,\" Mr Nalder said. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment in DairyCare was an important step to protect and support waterways and regional estuaries by helping a valued industry to become more sustainable.  \"DairyCare will investigate innovative options for improving dairy effluent management and provide farmers with information, incentives and the tools to make better decisions about fertiliser use and effluent management,\" Mr Redman said.

A film festival for Exmouth, Speedway Sedans in Albany, the Karijini experience and the City to Surf's regional series are some of the events to benefit from funding through the initiative, co-ordinated by Tourism WA and made possible by the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett said the Regional Events Scheme provided vital support to kick-start and develop events which involved local communities and attracted visitors and media coverage. \"The record funding pool of up to $850,000 in 2016-17 has meant 12 events received sponsorship through the scheme for the first time, while more established events have the chance to grow bigger and better,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Including the latest recipients, the scheme has supported more than 300 regional events since 2011, helping to shape WA as an exciting destination with year-round activities to provide an extra drawcard for visitors.  \"Tourism is a major contributor to regional economies.\u00a0 In 2015, visitors spent $9 billion in the State, including $4 billion in regional areas.\u00a0 We want to see this regional contribution grow to $4.75 billion by 2020, and events are key to that goal.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment played a crucial role in positioning regional WA as a recognised tourism destination.  \"Regional events generate jobs and business opportunities for local communities, and deliver significant social and economic benefits to the regions,\" Mr Redman said. \"Strong regional communities bring prosperity to WA and I am pleased to see Royalties for Regions invest in the sustainability of our regions.\"  The 12 events receiving funding for the first time through the 2016-17 Regional Events Scheme are Ningalens Film Competition (Exmouth), Discovery Bay Trail Run (Albany), Speedway Sedans Australia National Super Sedan Championships (Albany), Qantas Wine Show of Western Australia (Mount Barker), AFL Masters WA Broome Carnival, Blues for the Bush and Community Open Day (Perenjori), King of the Cut (Mandurah), Karijini Experience (Karijini), City to Surf for Activ Regional Series (Karratha, Geraldton, Albany and Busselton), LiveLighter Harvey Harvest Festival (Harvey), Emergence Creative Festival (Margaret River) and X-Adventure Dunsborough (Dunsborough).

        "statement": "The Botanic Garden and Parks Authority and BHP Billiton Iron Ore have teamed up to meet the challenge of restoring landscapes in the Pilbara by publishing a new book on seeds of the arid North-West. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the book, the Pilbara Seed Atlas and Field Guide, was one of the outcomes of eight years of research through an industry partnership between the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority and BHP Billiton Iron Ore. \"This is one of the results of an important partnership with industry to help deliver better environmental outcomes in the Pilbara,\" Mr Jacob said.  \"The Pilbara Seed Atlas and Field Guide is the first of its kind to translate complex science into a practical tool to help miners, pastoralists and conservation managers to rehabilitate their land. \"I am impressed with the practicality of the book and how easy it is for people without scientific backgrounds to identify local plant species.  \"The book encourages the reader to look at the cumulative effects of mining and other activity on the region to restore landscapes as a whole, rather than restoring each site in isolation. \"The efficient and cost-effective solutions presented in this book are essential if we are to successfully restore the diversity of plants and animals and reconnect natural areas on a large scale.\" The book includes an identification guide for more than 100 common plant species, and how to collect, clean, store and germinate their seeds. The publication is one part of the Restoration Seedbank Initiative, a $5 million research partnership between the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, BHP Billiton Iron Ore and The University of Western Australia. The initiative focuses on achieving better results in seed storage and expanding Kings Park's seed research capacity to improve the ability to germinate and grow seeds for restoration. The research is developing new technologies, including coating seeds in polymer or clay-based mixes to aid germination and survival in a process called seed pelleting.\u00a0 This is helping to improve the industry average of just five per cent survival rate for seeds used in restoration.

        "statement": "A $5 million project to improve safety and traffic flow along a stretch of Toodyay Road has been completed, with a second $3 million upgrade now underway. Transport Minister Dean Nalder said Toodyay Road was a crucial east-west connection between Midland and Toodyay which carried more than 4,000 vehicles daily. \"The completion of the $5 million project, funded through the Liberal National Government's Safer Roads Program, will ensure the road is safer for the drivers and passengers in those vehicles, as well as local residents and businesses,\" he said. \"The improvements have been designed to reduce the likelihood of head-on or right-angle crashes, and will allow safer and easier access to roadside homes and other properties.\" Mr Nalder said key features of the completed $5 million project included: Deputy Premier and Road Safety Minister Liza Harvey said the next stage of the Toodyay Road safety upgrade, from Noble Falls east to Aspen Road, was now underway and expected to be completed by July 2016. \"The $3 million stage 2 project stemmed from the inaugural Wheatbelt Highway Safety Review and was funded by the Road Trauma Trust Account in the 2016-17 State Budget,\" she said. \"The project will improve safety by widening and sealing road shoulders, installing safety barriers and upgrading signposts.\"  Mrs Harvey said a record $146 million had been allocated from the Road Trauma Trust Account in 2016-17, of which nearly $8 million was to fund recommendations from the Wheatbelt Highway Safety Review.

In order to maximise immediate benefits to the local community, other complementary service providers will be housed in the building.  \"Centrecare has shown foresight by creating a building which will bring together local service providers, making it easier for people to access a number of services in one building,\" the Premier said. The building will also provide training and meeting rooms which will be available for use by local organisations.

Forward works for the major redevelopment of Scarborough's foreshore are underway.\u00a0 A large construction area along the beachfront has been fenced off to allow the safe demolition of existing buildings, removal of trees and ground excavation for the new waterfront public swimming pool. \"As a result of these major works, there will be changes to car parking, beach access, pedestrian and cycling paths in the area and visitors are advised to access the area from either Manning Street or Brighton Road,\" the Minister said. \"The State Government is working with the community and local businesses in an effort to minimise impacts wherever possible.\" Mrs Faragher said works would continue for the next 18 months with the enhanced Scarborough foreshore expected to be largely completed before the 2018 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships.

        "statement": "The Liberal National Government has won the right to host one of the world's biggest ocean sports events, securing the 2018 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships at Scarborough Beach. Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett said securing the championships, commonly known as the 'Aussies', was a great economic and tourism coup for Western Australia. \"When the championships were last held at Scarborough in 2014, it attracted nearly 8,000 visitors who spent $12.4 million during the seven days of the event,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We're hoping to see another great turnout and economic boost when the championships return in 2018.\" The Premier said hosting events such as the 2018 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships formed an important part of the State Government's strategy to increase the value of tourism to $12 billion by 2020. \"In 2015, visitors to WA spent $9 billion and we want to see that figure reach $12 billion over the next five years,\" he said. \"Events will help us reach that target as they add vibrancy to the State, attract visitors and help raise the profile of WA through media exposure.\" Deputy Premier Liza Harvey said the nationally televised Aussies would be the perfect way to show off the revitalised Scarborough Beach to the rest of Australia. \"Scarborough Beach is an important coastal tourism precinct because of its natural beauty and has the highest concentration of accommodation in the metropolitan area outside the CBD,\" Mrs Harvey said. \"The State Government has invested $48 million in revitalising Scarborough to help transform it into a world-class destination and tourist hotspot.\u00a0 With the public works being largely completed by the 2018 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships, the timing couldn't be better.\" Premier and Tourism Minister's office - 6552 5000 Deputy Premier's office - 6552 5900",

A film festival for Exmouth, Speedway Sedans in Albany, the Karijini experience and the City to Surf's regional series are some of the events to benefit from funding through the initiative, co-ordinated by Tourism WA and made possible by the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. Premier and Tourism Minister Colin Barnett said the Regional Events Scheme provided vital support to kick-start and develop events which involved local communities and attracted visitors and media coverage. \"The record funding pool of up to $850,000 in 2016-17 has meant 12 events received sponsorship through the scheme for the first time, while more established events have the chance to grow bigger and better,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Including the latest recipients, the scheme has supported more than 300 regional events since 2011, helping to shape WA as an exciting destination with year-round activities to provide an extra drawcard for visitors.  \"Tourism is a major contributor to regional economies.\u00a0 In 2015, visitors spent $9 billion in the State, including $4 billion in regional areas.\u00a0 We want to see this regional contribution grow to $4.75 billion by 2020, and events are key to that goal.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Royalties for Regions investment played a crucial role in positioning regional WA as a recognised tourism destination.  \"Regional events generate jobs and business opportunities for local communities, and deliver significant social and economic benefits to the regions,\" Mr Redman said. \"Strong regional communities bring prosperity to WA and I am pleased to see Royalties for Regions invest in the sustainability of our regions.\"  The 12 events receiving funding for the first time through the 2016-17 Regional Events Scheme are Ningalens Film Competition (Exmouth), Discovery Bay Trail Run (Albany), Speedway Sedans Australia National Super Sedan Championships (Albany), Qantas Wine Show of Western Australia (Mount Barker), AFL Masters WA Broome Carnival, Blues for the Bush and Community Open Day (Perenjori), King of the Cut (Mandurah), Karijini Experience (Karijini), City to Surf for Activ Regional Series (Karratha, Geraldton, Albany and Busselton), LiveLighter Harvey Harvest Festival (Harvey), Emergence Creative Festival (Margaret River) and X-Adventure Dunsborough (Dunsborough).

        "statement": "International medical graduates in the Goldfields region will continue to have access to high-quality education thanks to the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. The Forward to Fellowship program, facilitated by Rural Health West, provides international medical graduates with personal, professional and training support to help their integration into Australian medical general practice. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government's $532,100 investment would support the growing number of new international medical graduates practising in the area by offering further education in the region. \"The Forward to Fellowship program helps these graduates form partnerships with other general practitioners and supports doctors and their families by encouraging them to stay in the Goldfields-Esperance region after completing their Fellowship qualifications,\" Mr Redman said. \"The program has already resulted in a significant reduction in presentations at the Kalgoorlie Health Campus Emergency Department and is enabling the community to have easier access to general practitioners.\" Health Minister John Day said the program was a vital collaboration between organisations committed to delivering high-quality continuous education. \"This is about providing a stable and sustainable regional medical workforce,\" Mr Day said. \"With research showing 55 per cent of our rural and remote medical professionals have obtained their qualifications overseas, helping to provide a pathway for them to work here is making a big difference in regional Western Australia. \"Seventeen international medical graduates were in the program's initial cohort, with three already achieving Fellowships.\" Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700  Health Minister's office - 6552 6200 ",

This could not be achieved without well trained, dedicated and enthusiastic staff,\" Mr Jacob said. The Minister said the Western Shield award, which recognised commitment and excellence in animal conservation, had been awarded to Parks and Wildlife officer Robert Brazell, who had been with the project since its inception in 1996. \"Robert was a key person in developing and implementing the production of the Eradicat bait, a scientific breakthrough which has since successfully controlled feral cats in various locations across the State,\" he said. Department of Environment Regulation contaminated sites officer Rowena Beaton was recognised for being awarded a scholarship to complete a Master of Hydrogeology. \"Rowena is a key officer in the contaminated sites team who work to protect and improve the quality of our groundwater.\u00a0 I commend Rowena for embarking on education that will further this purpose,\" Mr Jacob said. The Fire Management Reward and Recognition Program Outstanding Leadership Award was presented to Parks and Wildlife South Coast regional manager Greg Mair.  \"Greg is one of the most respected bushfire incident controllers and has commanded some of the State's most significant bushfires during the past decade,\" the Minister said. Parks and Wildlife Aboriginal Trainee of the Year was Peter Curtin. \"Peter is an extremely worthy recipient who successfully completed his qualifications in a record time of 11 months,\" Mr Jacob said. \"I congratulate all the graduates and award recipients for their contributions to environmental management in Western Australia.\" Minister's office - 6552 5800",

        "statement": "Fifty-eight public officers from three State Government agencies have been congratulated for their outstanding efforts in environmental management.  Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the Liberal National Government was well placed to continue significant work in managing the State's natural environment with the leadership shown by the Department of Parks and Wildlife, Department of Environment Regulation and the Office of the Environmental Protection Authority. \"A wide array of programs in wildlife conservation, bushfire management, environmental regulation and park management are being successfully implemented across the State. This could not be achieved without well trained, dedicated and enthusiastic staff,\" Mr Jacob said. The Minister said the Western Shield award, which recognised commitment and excellence in animal conservation, had been awarded to Parks and Wildlife officer Robert Brazell, who had been with the project since its inception in 1996. \"Robert was a key person in developing and implementing the production of the Eradicat bait, a scientific breakthrough which has since successfully controlled feral cats in various locations across the State,\" he said. Department of Environment Regulation contaminated sites officer Rowena Beaton was recognised for being awarded a scholarship to complete a Master of Hydrogeology. \"Rowena is a key officer in the contaminated sites team who work to protect and improve the quality of our groundwater.\u00a0 I commend Rowena for embarking on education that will further this purpose,\" Mr Jacob said. The Fire Management Reward and Recognition Program Outstanding Leadership Award was presented to Parks and Wildlife South Coast regional manager Greg Mair.  \"Greg is one of the most respected bushfire incident controllers and has commanded some of the State's most significant bushfires during the past decade,\" the Minister said. Parks and Wildlife Aboriginal Trainee of the Year was Peter Curtin. \"Peter is an extremely worthy recipient who successfully completed his qualifications in a record time of 11 months,\" Mr Jacob said. \"I congratulate all the graduates and award recipients for their contributions to environmental management in Western Australia.\" Minister's office - 6552 5800",

        "statement": "Up to 80 critically endangered woylies have been moved to three sites from the Department of Parks and Wildlife's Perup Sanctuary, near Manjimup, to help with recovery efforts of the species. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the recovery of the woylie, a small marsupial, was a part of the Liberal National Government's Western Shield wildlife conservation program, which was working to reduce the threat of foxes and feral cats on native animals. About half the woylies have been taken to Australian Wildlife Conservancy's (AWC) wildlife sanctuaries at Mount Gibson, 350km north of Perth, and Karakamia at Chidlow, about 50km north-east of Perth.\u00a0 The remaining woylies have been transported to Dryandra Woodland, near Narrogin in the Wheatbelt region. The woylies moved to AWC properties have been released in feral predator-free sanctuaries to supplement animals that were moved to these sites in 2015, while the animals moved to Dryandra have added to the wild population there and increased the genetic diversity of this important population. \"The Perup Sanctuary supports the most genetically diverse woylie population in the State and this transfer of the marsupials is part of conservation efforts focused on establishing insurance populations across a range of locations,\" Mr Jacob said. The woylie population is estimated to be less than 20,000 in Australia, including 400 to 600 of the marsupials in the Perup Sanctuary, with the only wild populations remaining in Dryandra and the Upper Warren in the State's south-west.  The Minister said genetic diversity of woylies at Perup and in the wild made them the most important in Australia. \"These wild populations remain vulnerable to predation by foxes and cats and potential disease outbreaks,\" he said. \"The partnership between Parks and Wildlife and AWC enables us to increase our capacity to conserve wildlife while also, and most importantly, increasing the number of populations of a critically endangered species.\" Minister's office - 6552 5800",

Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government's $500 million Southern Inland Health Initiative had been made possible by the Royalties for Regions program and was being delivered by the WA Country Health Service. \"As the Member for Warren-Blackwood, I'm pleased to see this new health facility come to fruition and for the people of Manjimup to be provided with a modern, well-equipped health facility that suit present and future needs,\" Mr Redman said. \"Royalties for Regions is transforming health care across regional Western Australia.\u00a0 Regional communities deserve access to a high level of health care and investing in health infrastructure and services can reduce the need for residents to travel to Perth for diagnosis or treatment.\" Health Minister's office - 6552 6200 Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700",

        "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett today announced that the new $1.2 billion Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) would begin treating its first patients in late October 2016. \"Perth Children's Hospital will be a world-class paediatric centre with modern facilities, advanced technologies and new ways of working, which will bring enormous benefits for patients, families and staff,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We made a decision very early in our first term of Government that we would build a new children's hospital to serve the community well into the next century.\u00a0 It was always a priority over the construction of a new stadium. \"This is a direct benefit of the State's period of economic prosperity after changes in 2010 to 11 Iron Ore State Agreements held by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto allowed the Liberal National Government to allocate $350 million towards PCH. \"It is planned for the first outpatient clinics to start on October 24, followed by the start of selected day surgery from November 7, with the final patient move from Princess Margaret Hospital for Children planned for Sunday, November 20. \"This is an exciting milestone which highlights the State Government's clear commitment to improve health outcomes for our children, now and into the future. \"Although commissioning such an advanced hospital is a challenging task, the Government has delivered many new hospitals in recent years and that considerable experience is being used to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.\" Health Minister John Day said it was important to schedule key commissioning target dates. \"This ensures appropriate and accurate planning for the transition period because all equipment, systems and treatment processes must be repeatedly tested before we begin treating our young patients at the new facility,\" Mr Day said.  \"The hospital opening will be a tremendous achievement, with PCH forming the centre of a network of new and expanded facilities for children and families that we have built across the State.  \"We will not compromise safety, and the hospital will only accept patients on the planned dates if construction and commissioning activities are complete and the move can be done safely.\" The Premier said he was pleased to see the significant progress in construction which had meant commissioning and moving plans could be finalised. \"It has been a very complex project, however the result is a world-class facility all West Australians can be proud of,\" he said. \"The hospital is on track for building handover in August, however many areas such as intensive care and operating theatres are already being accessed by PCH commissioning team staff.\" Princess Margaret Hospital for Children will remain open as the State's only dedicated paediatric hospital and major trauma centre until the final patient move to PCH.

        "statement": "Up to 80 critically endangered woylies have been moved to three sites from the Department of Parks and Wildlife's Perup Sanctuary, near Manjimup, to help with recovery efforts of the species. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the recovery of the woylie, a small marsupial, was a part of the Liberal National Government's Western Shield wildlife conservation program, which was working to reduce the threat of foxes and feral cats on native animals. About half the woylies have been taken to Australian Wildlife Conservancy's (AWC) wildlife sanctuaries at Mount Gibson, 350km north of Perth, and Karakamia at Chidlow, about 50km north-east of Perth.\u00a0 The remaining woylies have been transported to Dryandra Woodland, near Narrogin in the Wheatbelt region. The woylies moved to AWC properties have been released in feral predator-free sanctuaries to supplement animals that were moved to these sites in 2015, while the animals moved to Dryandra have added to the wild population there and increased the genetic diversity of this important population. \"The Perup Sanctuary supports the most genetically diverse woylie population in the State and this transfer of the marsupials is part of conservation efforts focused on establishing insurance populations across a range of locations,\" Mr Jacob said. The woylie population is estimated to be less than 20,000 in Australia, including 400 to 600 of the marsupials in the Perup Sanctuary, with the only wild populations remaining in Dryandra and the Upper Warren in the State's south-west.  The Minister said genetic diversity of woylies at Perup and in the wild made them the most important in Australia. \"These wild populations remain vulnerable to predation by foxes and cats and potential disease outbreaks,\" he said. \"The partnership between Parks and Wildlife and AWC enables us to increase our capacity to conserve wildlife while also, and most importantly, increasing the number of populations of a critically endangered species.\" Minister's office - 6552 5800",

The project, which will generate about 20 jobs, is being funded by the Liberal National Government's Bridge Safety Improvement Program. The refurbishment work will be managed by Main Roads Western Australia and is due to be completed by December 2016. The contract for the $2.1 million refurbishment project was awarded to local construction company Watpac Civil and Mining. Minister's office - 6552 6400",

        "state": "WA",
        "location": "Shire",
        "statement": "A completed stormwater harvesting project in the Shire of Beverley will provide more than 22 million litres of extra water per year for use by the community. Water Minister Mia Davies officially launched the project today, which was supported by a $100,000 grant through the Liberal National Government's Community Water Supply Program. \"In this drying climate, having a secure water supply for our ovals, parks and community needs is something we have to work harder to achieve,\" Ms Davies said. \"Innovative use of natural and man-made features to harvest stormwater now means Beverley has a substantial volume of water that was never available in the past. \"This harvested water that used to run down the street can now meet up to 50 per cent of the town's public open space irrigation needs, as well as provide water for emergencies.\" The Beverley stormwater harvesting project involved construction of two stormwater retention basins with a combined capacity of four million litres to capture water from the town's streets. As the basins fill during high rainfall events, water is pumped to existing tanks at sports ovals and to the 20 megalitre town dam to optimise storage.  The Shire of Beverley contributed $209,143 to create the innovative water harvesting project, which results in an extra 22.5 million litres of water being available for use. \"This will greatly improve the town's self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on costly and valuable scheme water for non-potable needs,\" the Minister said. Optimisation of storage in the 20 megalitre capacity town dam may in the future also provide emergency livestock water for farmers during dry periods, and water for firefighting needs.  The Community Water Supply Program is managed by the Department of Water. Minister's office - 6552 5500",

Regional Development and Lands Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government investment would have a significant and lasting impact on the traditional business, entertainment and retail centre of Broome. The project consists of improvements such as major upgrades to Carnarvon Street and Dampier Terrace, as well as feasibility and technical studies for projects including a cultural centre, the extension of Gray Street and the reconnection of Chinatown to Roebuck Bay. \"Chinatown has a rich multicultural and industrial history which presents unique opportunities for growth of the town centre through projects that will boost the economic potential for local businesses and the retail and tourism sectors,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Shire of Broome and LandCorp will deliver the Chinatown Revitalisation project in partnership with the Kimberley Development Commission, building on this vibrant precinct that highlights its continuing strong Aboriginal cultural heritage and pearling history. \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions provides substantial investment to regional communities, ensuring they continue to thrive socially and economically.\" The project will receive extra investment including $2 million from the Shire of Broome and $600,000 from the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure program, a Federal Government-funded initiative managed by Tourism Western Australia. The Minister said the funding would enable the partnership to deliver on preparatory work undertaken over the last few years, building on from the shire's Chinatown Development Strategy and the Broome Growth Plan. \"Revitalising Chinatown is important for the town's future and we will now be able to go ahead and reinvigorate the traditional heart of Broome, delivering short, medium and long-term benefits to the local economy,\" he said.

        "statement": "Regional Development Minister Terry Redman has today officially opened The Quarter precinct in Karratha. The Quarter was built by Western Australian construction company Doric and offers 46 service-worker apartments, 6,000 square metres of commercial and retail space in a four-storey building, a car park and new public space.\u00a0 Businesses have already leased, or are in negotiations over leasing, about 70 per cent of space in the commercial building known as The Quarter HQ. Mr Redman said The Quarter was supported by $66.7 million from the State Government's Royalties for Regions to provide extra opportunities for existing and new businesses to establish a presence in the revitalised city centre. \"The Karratha city centre revitalisation is a major part of the Liberal National Government's Pilbara Cities initiative to ensure its towns and cities can sustain economic growth and support vibrant communities for generations to come,\" he said. \"LandCorp, Mirvac and Doric worked together to deliver this dynamic project on time and on budget while still achieving $22 million of contracts for local jobs. \"The Pilbara exports the vast majority of Australia's iron ore and LNG and the region supports thousands of local workers and it is critical we continue to invest in our regional centres to make sure they are places people want to work, live and raise a family. \"There is a need for new spaces for small businesses in Karratha and affordable housing for those who work in them and The Quarter is now helping to provide those opportunities.\" The Minister said Karratha was transforming from a functional resources town to one of the State's premier commercial and cultural hubs and continued to evolve. \"The next major project to be delivered in the region will be the $207 million Karratha Health Campus that will provide the city and surrounding communities with state-of-the-art medical facilities and health care services,\" he said.

        "statement": "Chinatown in Broome will undergo a major revitalisation following a $10 million investment made possible by the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. Regional Development and Lands Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government investment would have a significant and lasting impact on the traditional business, entertainment and retail centre of Broome. The project consists of improvements such as major upgrades to Carnarvon Street and Dampier Terrace, as well as feasibility and technical studies for projects including a cultural centre, the extension of Gray Street and the reconnection of Chinatown to Roebuck Bay. \"Chinatown has a rich multicultural and industrial history which presents unique opportunities for growth of the town centre through projects that will boost the economic potential for local businesses and the retail and tourism sectors,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Shire of Broome and LandCorp will deliver the Chinatown Revitalisation project in partnership with the Kimberley Development Commission, building on this vibrant precinct that highlights its continuing strong Aboriginal cultural heritage and pearling history. \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions provides substantial investment to regional communities, ensuring they continue to thrive socially and economically.\" The project will receive extra investment including $2 million from the Shire of Broome and $600,000 from the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure program, a Federal Government-funded initiative managed by Tourism Western Australia. The Minister said the funding would enable the partnership to deliver on preparatory work undertaken over the last few years, building on from the shire's Chinatown Development Strategy and the Broome Growth Plan. \"Revitalising Chinatown is important for the town's future and we will now be able to go ahead and reinvigorate the traditional heart of Broome, delivering short, medium and long-term benefits to the local economy,\" he said.

Mr Marmion today inspected a range of Rio Tinto's Pilbara operations, where the company's advanced automation makes it one of the world's most efficient iron ore production centres. \"This expertise in automation, computing and problem solving provides an ideal springboard for broader innovation, which is exactly what the Liberal National Government's $20 million innovation package seeks to encourage to help drive industries across the State,\" he said. \"Rio Tinto's Mine of the Future programme is a cross-company, multi-commodity initiative to improve safety and productivity through the use of innovative automated technology. \"Western Australian workers are playing a vital part in the roll-out of this technology, which is helping to cement our State as a global centre for innovation in the resources sector.\" Mr Marmion visited the Greater Brockman operations near Tom Price, which includes the Brockman 2, Brockman 4 and Nammuldi mining operations. The Minister\u00a0said Rio Tinto's iron ore group was the world's largest operator of autonomous trucks, with 30 in use at Nammuldi and another 43 across the company's Pilbara operations. \"These trucks have decreased load and haul operating costs by up to 13 per cent, and increased effective utilisation by up to 14 per cent compared with a manned fleet,\" he said. \"Seven fully autonomous drills are also in use across Rio Tinto's Pilbara operations, which use GPS technology to perform precise drilling work 24 hours per day.\" Mr Marmion said the company was also working towards installation of the world's first fully autonomous, heavy haulage, long-distance rail system across 1,500 kilometres of its Pilbara network.  \"Central to all of this work is the company's Perth-based operations centre, which acts as a single 'mission control' for all autonomous activities,\" he said.

        "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett today announced that the new $1.2 billion Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) would begin treating its first patients in late October 2016. \"Perth Children's Hospital will be a world-class paediatric centre with modern facilities, advanced technologies and new ways of working, which will bring enormous benefits for patients, families and staff,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We made a decision very early in our first term of Government that we would build a new children's hospital to serve the community well into the next century.\u00a0 It was always a priority over the construction of a new stadium. \"This is a direct benefit of the State's period of economic prosperity after changes in 2010 to 11 Iron Ore State Agreements held by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto allowed the Liberal National Government to allocate $350 million towards PCH. \"It is planned for the first outpatient clinics to start on October 24, followed by the start of selected day surgery from November 7, with the final patient move from Princess Margaret Hospital for Children planned for Sunday, November 20. \"This is an exciting milestone which highlights the State Government's clear commitment to improve health outcomes for our children, now and into the future. \"Although commissioning such an advanced hospital is a challenging task, the Government has delivered many new hospitals in recent years and that considerable experience is being used to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.\" Health Minister John Day said it was important to schedule key commissioning target dates. \"This ensures appropriate and accurate planning for the transition period because all equipment, systems and treatment processes must be repeatedly tested before we begin treating our young patients at the new facility,\" Mr Day said.  \"The hospital opening will be a tremendous achievement, with PCH forming the centre of a network of new and expanded facilities for children and families that we have built across the State.  \"We will not compromise safety, and the hospital will only accept patients on the planned dates if construction and commissioning activities are complete and the move can be done safely.\" The Premier said he was pleased to see the significant progress in construction which had meant commissioning and moving plans could be finalised. \"It has been a very complex project, however the result is a world-class facility all West Australians can be proud of,\" he said. \"The hospital is on track for building handover in August, however many areas such as intensive care and operating theatres are already being accessed by PCH commissioning team staff.\" Princess Margaret Hospital for Children will remain open as the State's only dedicated paediatric hospital and major trauma centre until the final patient move to PCH.

        "statement": "World-leading Western Australian mining technology provides an important part of the knowledge base that will drive WA's expanding innovation sector, Innovation Minister Bill Marmion said today. Mr Marmion today inspected a range of Rio Tinto's Pilbara operations, where the company's advanced automation makes it one of the world's most efficient iron ore production centres. \"This expertise in automation, computing and problem solving provides an ideal springboard for broader innovation, which is exactly what the Liberal National Government's $20 million innovation package seeks to encourage to help drive industries across the State,\" he said. \"Rio Tinto's Mine of the Future programme is a cross-company, multi-commodity initiative to improve safety and productivity through the use of innovative automated technology. \"Western Australian workers are playing a vital part in the roll-out of this technology, which is helping to cement our State as a global centre for innovation in the resources sector.\" Mr Marmion visited the Greater Brockman operations near Tom Price, which includes the Brockman 2, Brockman 4 and Nammuldi mining operations. The Minister\u00a0said Rio Tinto's iron ore group was the world's largest operator of autonomous trucks, with 30 in use at Nammuldi and another 43 across the company's Pilbara operations. \"These trucks have decreased load and haul operating costs by up to 13 per cent, and increased effective utilisation by up to 14 per cent compared with a manned fleet,\" he said. \"Seven fully autonomous drills are also in use across Rio Tinto's Pilbara operations, which use GPS technology to perform precise drilling work 24 hours per day.\" Mr Marmion said the company was also working towards installation of the world's first fully autonomous, heavy haulage, long-distance rail system across 1,500 kilometres of its Pilbara network.  \"Central to all of this work is the company's Perth-based operations centre, which acts as a single 'mission control' for all autonomous activities,\" he said.

Mrs Harvey said $1.8 million was allocated in the 2016-17 State Budget to complete the funding commitment for the $2.7 million project.\u00a0 A total of $2 million of this was from the State Government's Royalties for Regions program. \"The hub is part of a wider campus strategy to promote shared learning experiences, socialisation and positive engagement of students and staff in campus life,\" she said. \"The hub will be a 'one-stop-shop' for student advisory and support services, course and careers information, and library and learning resource services.\u00a0 It will provide a connection between formal learning undertaken in classrooms and the informal, self-directed learning which is increasingly sought by students.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the contemporary learning environment would support innovative and flexible training delivery to encourage greater student participation.  \"This Royalties for Regions investment will contribute towards a vibrant and engaged workforce that can capitalise on the projected growth in regional employment,\" Mr Redman said.  \"Royalties for Regions is building regional Western Australia's economic sustainability and I look forward to seeing the benefits in our regional communities.\" Deputy Premier and Training and Workforce Development Minister's office - 6552 5900 Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700",

Speaking at the event, organised by Celebrate WA, Mr Barnett said WA Day was not only about looking forward, but also recognising Aboriginal and subsequent settlement of WA and the enormous contribution migrants had made to the State. \"WA's history dates back more than 40,000 years, with the first inhabitants of the South-West being the Noongar people,\" he said. \"Recently, State Parliament passed the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Bill 2015, which formally recognises the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West.  \"It is significant that the Bill will be proclaimed on June 6, 2016, which this year will be WA Day. \"This is a historic occasion and an achievement of which the Liberal National Government is proud.\u00a0 It embodies the spirit of the WA Day holiday.\" The Premier encouraged West Australians to enjoy some of the major events being held across the State over the long weekend.\u00a0 These included a WA Day Festival at Elizabeth Quay on Monday, featuring free family activities such as WA's best burger cook-off and workshops with Western Australian sport stars. Family activities would also be held at Esplanade Park in Fremantle and at the Western Australian Museum in Albany, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\u00a0 Port Hedland and Mandurah were also hosting festivals.

The Minister said excessive alcohol consumption had a link to domestic violence across the Fitzroy Valley and WA Police were able to use the liquor restrictions as an effective tool in ensuring alcohol-driven issues were better managed within the community.  \"The restrictions also give the community itself the ability to control behaviour and reduce incidents of violence and antisocial behaviour,\" he said.  \"I am told local police are working with the Kurungal Council, which has applied for crime prevention funding to start their own community patrols enforcing liquor restrictions. This is an encouraging development.\"  Penalties for breaches of the regulations range from $2,000 for an individual to $5,000 for a licensee or manager. Minister's office - 6552 6100",

        "statement": "The Liberal National Government today announced $20.73 million of Royalties for Regions investment for the second stage of Bunbury waterfront, including the development of Casuarina Drive and the Jetty Road causeway. This investment builds on the Liberal National Government's recent investment into Bunbury's waterfront of $24.9 million to revitalise Koombana Bay and redevelop Dolphin Discovery Centre. Premier Colin Barnett said the second stage would deliver infrastructure essential to meet the current and future demands of the new marina and establish a foundation for future stages. \"The investment will continue the transformation of Bunbury's waterfront, enhancing and integrating two key locations: Casuarina Drive, including BP Beach and the foreshore, and Jetty Road causeway,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Improving the city's shorelines for community use and providing the necessary infrastructure will increase visitation and stimulate growth of the local marine and tourism industries.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the investment would deliver improved access and pathways throughout the waterfront, with additional amenities including a boardwalk and plaza as well as addressing issues with coastal erosion. \"Casuarina harbour and BP Beach are popular areas, but lacking in appropriate amenities,\" Mr Redman said. \"The establishment of critical infrastructure and amenities is the catalyst for the future development of the waterfront and an important part of the vision for Bunbury.\" Mr Redman said maximising the potential of the area and creating a vibrant community space would develop the waterfront into a significant tourism asset for the State, further boosting the tourism profile and economic growth of Bunbury and the region. Bunbury is also part of the Regional Centres Development Plan, a key policy initiative, which aims to co-ordinate local decision making and support economic development to drive regional growth across Western Australia.

Regional Development and Lands Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government investment would have a significant and lasting impact on the traditional business, entertainment and retail centre of Broome. The project consists of improvements such as major upgrades to Carnarvon Street and Dampier Terrace, as well as feasibility and technical studies for projects including a cultural centre, the extension of Gray Street and the reconnection of Chinatown to Roebuck Bay. \"Chinatown has a rich multicultural and industrial history which presents unique opportunities for growth of the town centre through projects that will boost the economic potential for local businesses and the retail and tourism sectors,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Shire of Broome and LandCorp will deliver the Chinatown Revitalisation project in partnership with the Kimberley Development Commission, building on this vibrant precinct that highlights its continuing strong Aboriginal cultural heritage and pearling history. \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions provides substantial investment to regional communities, ensuring they continue to thrive socially and economically.\" The project will receive extra investment including $2 million from the Shire of Broome and $600,000 from the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure program, a Federal Government-funded initiative managed by Tourism Western Australia. The Minister said the funding would enable the partnership to deliver on preparatory work undertaken over the last few years, building on from the shire's Chinatown Development Strategy and the Broome Growth Plan. \"Revitalising Chinatown is important for the town's future and we will now be able to go ahead and reinvigorate the traditional heart of Broome, delivering short, medium and long-term benefits to the local economy,\" he said.

Speaking at the event, organised by Celebrate WA, Mr Barnett said WA Day was not only about looking forward, but also recognising Aboriginal and subsequent settlement of WA and the enormous contribution migrants had made to the State. \"WA's history dates back more than 40,000 years, with the first inhabitants of the South-West being the Noongar people,\" he said. \"Recently, State Parliament passed the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Bill 2015, which formally recognises the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West.  \"It is significant that the Bill will be proclaimed on June 6, 2016, which this year will be WA Day. \"This is a historic occasion and an achievement of which the Liberal National Government is proud.\u00a0 It embodies the spirit of the WA Day holiday.\" The Premier encouraged West Australians to enjoy some of the major events being held across the State over the long weekend.\u00a0 These included a WA Day Festival at Elizabeth Quay on Monday, featuring free family activities such as WA's best burger cook-off and workshops with Western Australian sport stars. Family activities would also be held at Esplanade Park in Fremantle and at the Western Australian Museum in Albany, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\u00a0 Port Hedland and Mandurah were also hosting festivals.

Bowler of the Year Awards for an outstanding season went to Noelene Abe of Corrigin, who received the Connie Hicks Brooch; and the Rosenthal Medal went to Tom Mitchell from Manning.  Other award winners were Robert Gibbons of the Gosnells Bowling Club (Volunteer of the Year); Ken Perks from the Morley Bowling Club (Coach of the Year); Tammin and Albany (Small Country Club and Country Club of the Year) and their metropolitan counterparts in Mundaring and Sorrento. \"Across the State, there are nearly 16,000 members of all ages who belong to 207 bowling clubs, all enjoying a sport which is keeping them active and connected,\" Ms Davies said. Bowls receives $150,000 annually in Organisational Sustainability Program funding from the Liberal National Government through the Department of Sport and Recreation.

Bowler of the Year Awards for an outstanding season went to Noelene Abe of Corrigin, who received the Connie Hicks Brooch; and the Rosenthal Medal went to Tom Mitchell from Manning.  Other award winners were Robert Gibbons of the Gosnells Bowling Club (Volunteer of the Year); Ken Perks from the Morley Bowling Club (Coach of the Year); Tammin and Albany (Small Country Club and Country Club of the Year) and their metropolitan counterparts in Mundaring and Sorrento. \"Across the State, there are nearly 16,000 members of all ages who belong to 207 bowling clubs, all enjoying a sport which is keeping them active and connected,\" Ms Davies said.

Future events at Elizabeth Quay will include the Swan Festival of Lights and the World Masters Athletics Championships welcoming ceremony, featuring thousands of athletes from around the globe.  Existing food and beverage offerings will also be expanded, with Gusto Gelato ready to host their official opening next Friday and Isle of Voyage set to open their doors soon at the Florence Hummerston Kiosk.\u00a0  \"In the lead-up to summer, there will be a raft of activities at Elizabeth Quay in terms of major public and community events, supported by new and exciting food and beverage outlets opening up in the precinct,\" Mrs Faragher said. \"Elizabeth Quay's city riverside location, its flexibility as an event and recreation space, and access to public transport is certainly contributing to its success as an emerging major tourism attraction for Western Australia.\" Minister's office - 6552 5300",

The Premier also congratulated other individual winners including Rishelle Hume, who received the Aboriginal Award; Warwick Hemsley - Arts and Culture Award; Dr John van Bockxmeer - Community Award; Professor Arlene Chan - Professions Award; Caitlin Bassett and Nathan Fyfe as joint winners of the Sport Award; and Ashlee Harrison - Youth Award. Speaking at the event, organised by Celebrate WA, Mr Barnett said WA Day was not only about looking forward, but also recognising Aboriginal and subsequent settlement of WA and the enormous contribution migrants had made to the State. \"WA's history dates back more than 40,000 years, with the first inhabitants of the South-West being the Noongar people,\" he said. \"Recently, State Parliament passed the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Bill 2015, which formally recognises the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West.  \"It is significant that the Bill will be proclaimed on June 6, 2016, which this year will be WA Day. \"This is a historic occasion and an achievement of which the Liberal National Government is proud.\u00a0 It embodies the spirit of the WA Day holiday.\" The Premier encouraged West Australians to enjoy some of the major events being held across the State over the long weekend.\u00a0 These included a WA Day Festival at Elizabeth Quay on Monday, featuring free family activities such as WA's best burger cook-off and workshops with Western Australian sport stars. Family activities would also be held at Esplanade Park in Fremantle and at the Western Australian Museum in Albany, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\u00a0 Port Hedland and Mandurah were also hosting festivals.

The Forward to Fellowship program, facilitated by Rural Health West, provides international medical graduates with personal, professional and training support to help their integration into Australian medical general practice. Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the Liberal National Government's $532,100 investment would support the growing number of new international medical graduates practising in the area by offering further education in the region. \"The Forward to Fellowship program helps these graduates form partnerships with other general practitioners and supports doctors and their families by encouraging them to stay in the Goldfields-Esperance region after completing their Fellowship qualifications,\" Mr Redman said. \"The program has already resulted in a significant reduction in presentations at the Kalgoorlie Health Campus Emergency Department and is enabling the community to have easier access to general practitioners.\" Health Minister John Day said the program was a vital collaboration between organisations committed to delivering high-quality continuous education. \"This is about providing a stable and sustainable regional medical workforce,\" Mr Day said. \"With research showing 55 per cent of our rural and remote medical professionals have obtained their qualifications overseas, helping to provide a pathway for them to work here is making a big difference in regional Western Australia. \"Seventeen international medical graduates were in the program's initial cohort, with three already achieving Fellowships.\" Regional Development Minister's office - 6552 6700  Health Minister's office - 6552 6200 ",

        "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett has congratulated Perth businessman and community leader Adrian Fini OAM on being named the 2016 Western Australian of the Year. \"This prestigious award is well deserved by Adrian, who makes a significant contribution to the Western Australian community through his roles as chairman of the Art Gallery of Western Australia Foundation and on the boards of The University of Western Australia Business School and Perth International Arts Festival,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Through his property development businesses, Adrian has also helped to shape a new, contemporary Perth city.\u00a0 His company's work on the restoration of the State Buildings was exemplary.\" Mr Fini received the honour at a gala Western Australian of the Year Awards ceremony held tonight at Crown Perth.  The Premier also congratulated other individual winners including Rishelle Hume, who received the Aboriginal Award; Warwick Hemsley - Arts and Culture Award; Dr John van Bockxmeer - Community Award; Professor Arlene Chan - Professions Award; Caitlin Bassett and Nathan Fyfe as joint winners of the Sport Award; and Ashlee Harrison - Youth Award. Speaking at the event, organised by Celebrate WA, Mr Barnett said WA Day was not only about looking forward, but also recognising Aboriginal and subsequent settlement of WA and the enormous contribution migrants had made to the State. \"WA's history dates back more than 40,000 years, with the first inhabitants of the South-West being the Noongar people,\" he said. \"Recently, State Parliament passed the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Bill 2015, which formally recognises the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the land in the South-West.  \"It is significant that the Bill will be proclaimed on June 6, 2016, which this year will be WA Day. \"This is a historic occasion and an achievement of which the Liberal National Government is proud.\u00a0 It embodies the spirit of the WA Day holiday.\" The Premier encouraged West Australians to enjoy some of the major events being held across the State over the long weekend.\u00a0 These included a WA Day Festival at Elizabeth Quay on Monday, featuring free family activities such as WA's best burger cook-off and workshops with Western Australian sport stars. Family activities would also be held at Esplanade Park in Fremantle and at the Western Australian Museum in Albany, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie-Boulder.\u00a0 Port Hedland and Mandurah were also hosting festivals.

Regional Development Minster Terry Redman said the Kalgoorlie Central Hannan Precinct revitalisation project, Goldfields Rehabilitation Services and the Killarney Retirement Living project would all receive funding under the fund. \"The fund is helping build a social and infrastructure platform for the region's economic development and will drive growth and new investment,\" Mr Redman said. \"Royalties for Regions is investing in initiatives that deliver tangible benefits to regional communities.\" The Kalgoorlie Central Hannan Precinct revitalisation will receive $8 million in Liberal National Government funding for the revitalisation of St Barbara Square area and Cassidy Street.  Goldfields Rehabilitation Services will use their $2.78 million funding boost for a drug and alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation program and the refurbishment of the existing facility and the construction of a new building in Kalgoorlie-Boulder. The Killarney Retirement Living project will receive $9.8 million for the construction of a 45-unit independent living accommodation for pensioners living in the Goldfields-Esperance region.\u00a0  The Goldfields-Esperance Revitalisation Fund is a Royalties for Regions initiative that invests in priority projects to support economic and social development in the region.  \"I would like to congratulate the Goldfields-Esperance Development Commission for their hard work to ensure the projects are robust and will deliver significant benefits to the region,\" the Minister said.

        "statement": "Premier Colin Barnett today announced that the new $1.2 billion Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) would begin treating its first patients in late October 2016. \"Perth Children's Hospital will be a world-class paediatric centre with modern facilities, advanced technologies and new ways of working, which will bring enormous benefits for patients, families and staff,\" Mr Barnett said. \"We made a decision very early in our first term of Government that we would build a new children's hospital to serve the community well into the next century.\u00a0 It was always a priority over the construction of a new stadium. \"This is a direct benefit of the State's period of economic prosperity after changes in 2010 to 11 Iron Ore State Agreements held by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto allowed the Liberal National Government to allocate $350 million towards PCH. \"It is planned for the first outpatient clinics to start on October 24, followed by the start of selected day surgery from November 7, with the final patient move from Princess Margaret Hospital for Children planned for Sunday, November 20. \"This is an exciting milestone which highlights the State Government's clear commitment to improve health outcomes for our children, now and into the future. \"Although commissioning such an advanced hospital is a challenging task, the Government has delivered many new hospitals in recent years and that considerable experience is being used to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.\" Health Minister John Day said it was important to schedule key commissioning target dates. \"This ensures appropriate and accurate planning for the transition period because all equipment, systems and treatment processes must be repeatedly tested before we begin treating our young patients at the new facility,\" Mr Day said.  \"The hospital opening will be a tremendous achievement, with PCH forming the centre of a network of new and expanded facilities for children and families that we have built across the State.  \"We will not compromise safety, and the hospital will only accept patients on the planned dates if construction and commissioning activities are complete and the move can be done safely.\" The Premier said he was pleased to see the significant progress in construction which had meant commissioning and moving plans could be finalised. \"It has been a very complex project, however the result is a world-class facility all West Australians can be proud of,\" he said. \"The hospital is on track for building handover in August, however many areas such as intensive care and operating theatres are already being accessed by PCH commissioning team staff.\" Princess Margaret Hospital for Children will remain open as the State's only dedicated paediatric hospital and major trauma centre until the final patient move to PCH.

        "location": "Shire",
        "statement": "A completed stormwater harvesting project in the Shire of Beverley will provide more than 22 million litres of extra water per year for use by the community. Water Minister Mia Davies officially launched the project today, which was supported by a $100,000 grant through the Liberal National Government's Community Water Supply Program. \"In this drying climate, having a secure water supply for our ovals, parks and community needs is something we have to work harder to achieve,\" Ms Davies said. \"Innovative use of natural and man-made features to harvest stormwater now means Beverley has a substantial volume of water that was never available in the past. \"This harvested water that used to run down the street can now meet up to 50 per cent of the town's public open space irrigation needs, as well as provide water for emergencies.\" The Beverley stormwater harvesting project involved construction of two stormwater retention basins with a combined capacity of four million litres to capture water from the town's streets. As the basins fill during high rainfall events, water is pumped to existing tanks at sports ovals and to the 20 megalitre town dam to optimise storage.  The Shire of Beverley contributed $209,143 to create the innovative water harvesting project, which results in an extra 22.5 million litres of water being available for use. \"This will greatly improve the town's self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on costly and valuable scheme water for non-potable needs,\" the Minister said. Optimisation of storage in the 20 megalitre capacity town dam may in the future also provide emergency livestock water for farmers during dry periods, and water for firefighting needs.  The Community Water Supply Program is managed by the Department of Water. Minister's office - 6552 5500",

The project consists of improvements such as major upgrades to Carnarvon Street and Dampier Terrace, as well as feasibility and technical studies for projects including a cultural centre, the extension of Gray Street and the reconnection of Chinatown to Roebuck Bay. \"Chinatown has a rich multicultural and industrial history which presents unique opportunities for growth of the town centre through projects that will boost the economic potential for local businesses and the retail and tourism sectors,\" Mr Redman said. \"The Shire of Broome and LandCorp will deliver the Chinatown Revitalisation project in partnership with the Kimberley Development Commission, building on this vibrant precinct that highlights its continuing strong Aboriginal cultural heritage and pearling history. \"This is another example of how Royalties for Regions provides substantial investment to regional communities, ensuring they continue to thrive socially and economically.\" The project will receive extra investment including $2 million from the Shire of Broome and $600,000 from the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure program, a Federal Government-funded initiative managed by Tourism Western Australia. The Minister said the funding would enable the partnership to deliver on preparatory work undertaken over the last few years, building on from the shire's Chinatown Development Strategy and the Broome Growth Plan. \"Revitalising Chinatown is important for the town's future and we will now be able to go ahead and reinvigorate the traditional heart of Broome, delivering short, medium and long-term benefits to the local economy,\" he said.

Planning Minister Donna Faragher said the nine-member advisory group would provide input into the proposed road extensions and traffic network design associated with the Scarborough Master Plan.\u00a0 The plan includes the first stage foreshore redevelopment scheduled for completion in 2018. \"The community advisory group is being established to represent all sections of the local community including businesses, residents and local environmental groups,\" Mrs Faragher said. \"It will provide feedback into the planning, development and design of the proposed road network in the area, including the future extensions of The Esplanade as outlined in the Scarborough Master Plan. \"I have called for expressions of interest from community representatives with an interest in the redevelopment of Scarborough and nominations close on Friday, July 1.\" The community advisory group will be chaired by North Metropolitan Region MLC Liz Behjat and will include representatives from the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority and the City of Stirling.\u00a0 The group is expected to hold its first meeting in July 2016.  Forward works for the major redevelopment of Scarborough's foreshore are underway.\u00a0 A large construction area along the beachfront has been fenced off to allow the safe demolition of existing buildings, removal of trees and ground excavation for the new waterfront public swimming pool. \"As a result of these major works, there will be changes to car parking, beach access, pedestrian and cycling paths in the area and visitors are advised to access the area from either Manning Street or Brighton Road,\" the Minister said. \"The State Government is working with the community and local businesses in an effort to minimise impacts wherever possible.\" Mrs Faragher said works would continue for the next 18 months with the enhanced Scarborough foreshore expected to be largely completed before the 2018 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships.

        "statement": "The Liberal National Government today announced $20.73 million of Royalties for Regions investment for the second stage of Bunbury waterfront, including the development of Casuarina Drive and the Jetty Road causeway. This investment builds on the Liberal National Government's recent investment into Bunbury's waterfront of $24.9 million to revitalise Koombana Bay and redevelop Dolphin Discovery Centre. Premier Colin Barnett said the second stage would deliver infrastructure essential to meet the current and future demands of the new marina and establish a foundation for future stages. \"The investment will continue the transformation of Bunbury's waterfront, enhancing and integrating two key locations: Casuarina Drive, including BP Beach and the foreshore, and Jetty Road causeway,\" Mr Barnett said. \"Improving the city's shorelines for community use and providing the necessary infrastructure will increase visitation and stimulate growth of the local marine and tourism industries.\" Regional Development Minister Terry Redman said the investment would deliver improved access and pathways throughout the waterfront, with additional amenities including a boardwalk and plaza as well as addressing issues with coastal erosion. \"Casuarina harbour and BP Beach are popular areas, but lacking in appropriate amenities,\" Mr Redman said. \"The establishment of critical infrastructure and amenities is the catalyst for the future development of the waterfront and an important part of the vision for Bunbury.\" Mr Redman said maximising the potential of the area and creating a vibrant community space would develop the waterfront into a significant tourism asset for the State, further boosting the tourism profile and economic growth of Bunbury and the region. Bunbury is also part of the Regional Centres Development Plan, a key policy initiative, which aims to co-ordinate local decision making and support economic development to drive regional growth across Western Australia.

        "statement": "Two runners from Japan will compete in this Sunday's Perth Marathon and Relay in celebration of the Sister State relationship between Western Australia and the Hyogo Prefecture. State Development Minister Bill Marmion said the Liberal National Government strongly supported the annual marathon exchange program.\u00a0 The program began in 2011, as part of celebrations for the 30th anniversary of the Sister State relationship. \"I'm delighted to welcome runners Masahiro Fujita and Mei Matsuyama to WA to take part in the Perth Marathon in the 35th year of our Sister State relationship,\" Mr Marmion said. \"WA deeply values its relationship with the Hyogo Prefecture, and with Japan more broadly. \"Every second year, we send Western Australian runners to take part in the Kobe Marathon in Japan.\u00a0 This year, it is the Hyogo Prefecture's turn to send runners to WA.\" Mr Fujita and Ms Matsuyama were selected to take part in this year's exchange based on their strong performance in last year's Kobe Marathon. \"Japan was an essential early investor in the State's resources sector, and two-way trade between WA and Japan was valued at $19 billion in 2015,\" the Minister said. \"Our cultural ties are also strong, with about 3,500 Japanese-born people living in this State at the time of the 2011 Census.\" Another program conducted each year as part of the Sister State relationship is the Banshu Fashion Textile Program, where promising young Western Australian designers travel to Hyogo to learn traditional Japanese methods of textile-making.

        "statement": "A completed stormwater harvesting project in the Shire of Beverley will provide more than 22 million litres of extra water per year for use by the community. Water Minister Mia Davies officially launched the project today, which was supported by a $100,000 grant through the Liberal National Government's Community Water Supply Program. \"In this drying climate, having a secure water supply for our ovals, parks and community needs is something we have to work harder to achieve,\" Ms Davies said. \"Innovative use of natural and man-made features to harvest stormwater now means Beverley has a substantial volume of water that was never available in the past. \"This harvested water that used to run down the street can now meet up to 50 per cent of the town's public open space irrigation needs, as well as provide water for emergencies.\" The Beverley stormwater harvesting project involved construction of two stormwater retention basins with a combined capacity of four million litres to capture water from the town's streets. As the basins fill during high rainfall events, water is pumped to existing tanks at sports ovals and to the 20 megalitre town dam to optimise storage.  The Shire of Beverley contributed $209,143 to create the innovative water harvesting project, which results in an extra 22.5 million litres of water being available for use. \"This will greatly improve the town's self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on costly and valuable scheme water for non-potable needs,\" the Minister said. Optimisation of storage in the 20 megalitre capacity town dam may in the future also provide emergency livestock water for farmers during dry periods, and water for firefighting needs.
